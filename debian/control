Description: netCDF Operators
 NCO is a suite of programs known as operators.  The operators are 
 stand-alone, command-line programs executable in a POSIX shell.  
 Operators take one or more netCDF files as input, perform an 
 operation (e.g., averaging or hyperslabbing), and produce a netCDF
 output file. NCO was originally designed to manipulate and analyze
 climate data, though it works on any netCDF format datasets.
