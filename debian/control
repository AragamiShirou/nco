Description: netCDF Operators
 NCO is a suite of programs known as operators.  Each operator is
 a standalone, command line program that is executed at the UNIX
 shell-level.  The operators take one or more netCDF files as input,
 perform an operation (e.g., averaging or hyperslabbing), and produce
 a netCDF file as output.  The operators are primarily designed to aid
 manipulation and analysis of data.  This reflects their origin, but the
 operators are as general as netCDF itself.
