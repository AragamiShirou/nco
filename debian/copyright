This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the netCDF Operators
(NCO).

This package was originally put together by Brian Mays <brian@debian.org>
from software obtained from
 ftp://ftp.cgd.ucar.edu/pub/zender/nco/

Modifications of NCO package for Debian GNU/Linux made from 1999--2002

(on Debian systems see "/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL").

Beginning March, 2003, Charlie Zender merged Debian changes into 
upstream source in SourceForge CVS repository. 
More information at package homepage http://nco.sourceforge.net

On June 15, 2003, Charlie Zender changed the NCO license, except where  
explicitly noted otherwise, from GPL to GPL version 2 (not any later version).
Also at this time the explicit compatibility exceptions for the HDF, netCDF,
OPeNDAP, and UDUnits licenses were introduced.
