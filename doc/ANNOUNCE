The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.3 are ready.

This is a bug-fix release. There are no new features since 2.8.2.

There is one user-visible change:
1. Support for unpacking and packing is no longer considered beta,
so associated WARNING messages were removed because they are too scary.

There are two notable bug-fixes:
1. A large memory leak in ncap was reported, found, and fixed.
Thanks to Kevin, Rorik, and Henry, respectively.
2. Various smaller memory leaks fixed


Enjoy,
Charlie
