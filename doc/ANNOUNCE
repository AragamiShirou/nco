The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.9 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

There are fxm significant feature improvements in version 3.0.0.
These changes are mainly oriented toward stabilization.

1. libnco_c++ incorporates nco_put_vara() overloads, works with g++ 3.4.

2. fxm ncpdq packing and unpacking handles missing_value attributes better
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncpdq for details.

3. ncks prints data to screen by default if only one filename specified
   Formerly, four ncks switches (-H -m -M -u) were required to print all
   file data and metadata to screen. 
   Now ncks automatically prints data to screen when no output file
   is specified. Change scripts that rely on the old behavior.
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncks for details.

4. New -Z (or --64-bit-offset) switch on all operators writes output
   files in new 64-bit offset mode available only with netCDF 3.6.
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#lfs for details.

Enjoy,
Charlie
