The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.9 are ready.

There are fxm significant feature improvements in version 3.0.0.
These changes are mainly oriented toward stabilization.

1. libnco_c++ now incorporates nco_put_vara() overloads

2. fxm ncpdq packing and unpacking handles missing_value attributes better

3. ncks prints data to screen by default when only one filename specified
Formerly, three ncks switches (-H -m -M) were required to print all
file data to screen. 
Now ncks automatically prints input data to screen when no output file
is specified. Scripts that rely on the old behavior should be changed.
See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncks for details.

Enjoy,
Charlie
