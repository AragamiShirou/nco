The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.4.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release is mainly a bugfix and stability release. 
This release fixes a serious printing bug with ncks CDL and XML mode. 

Work on NCO 4.4.4 is underway, still focused on stability and speed.   
There will be more netCDF4 mop-up, improved group broadcasting
algorithms, and, possibly, improved HDF4 support, and new chunking
features.

Enjoy,
Charlie

"New stuff" in 4.4.3 summary (full details always in ChangeLog):

NEW FEATURES:

A. Hi
   

BUG FIXES:

A. Fix bug that caused CDL and XML printing to truncate trailing zeros
   of floating point exponents. Before this bugfix, ncks --cdl would
   print 1.100e-10 as 1.100e-1 instead of 1.1e-10. All CDL and XML
   printing prior to 4.4.4 mis-prints floating point numbers with
   exponents that end in zero (i.e., +/- 10, 20, 30 ... 200, 210...).
   Users of CDL and XML mode are urged to upgrade. This bug changed
   affected values by some multiple of 10 orders of magnitude. 
   Hence it is unlikely that you would be affected by this bug and NOT
   notice it.Thanks to Stubaan for reporting this.

KNOWN ISSUES NOT YET FIXED:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.4.3 built/tested with netCDF
   4.3.2-rc1 on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.12 with these methods: 

   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF library problem)
   Probe hidden attributes (chunking, compression) of HDF4 files

   Demonstration:
   ncdump -h -s ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (dies)
   ncks -m ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (works by avoiding fatal calls)

   20131230: Verified problem still exists

   Cause: some libnetCDF library functions fail on HDF4 file inquiries.
   Bug report filed: netCDF #HZY-708311 ncdump/netCDF4 segfaults probing HDF4 file
   Tracking tickets NCF-272, NCF-273

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug report filed: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

D. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails 

"Sticky" reminders:

A. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

B. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

C. Pre-built Windows (native) and Cygwin binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#windows

D. Pre-built AIX binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#aix

E. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, chunking, and groups.

F. Reminder that NCO works on most HDF4 and HDF5 datasets, e.g., 
   HDF4: AMSR MERRA MODIS ...
   HDF5: GLAS ICESat Mabel SBUV ...
   HDF-EOS5: AURA HIRDLS OMI ...
