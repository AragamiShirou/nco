The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.9 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.1.9 contains a small ncwa bugfix, new ncea/ncecat features,
new ncap2 features, configure support for AIX, and RPMs with ncap2.

A. Documentation bugfix: 
   Some ncap2 standard deviation examples neglected the anomaly step

B. Documentation bugfix: 
   ncap2 has never accepted the -d hyperslab argument

C. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
   ncap2 now accepts quoted variable names, e.g., 'HNO3-'
   Henry keeps adding features. See ~/nco/data/ncap2.in.
   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

E. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   Soon "apt-get install nco" will retrieve these versions.

F. We have built and distributing RPM packages with ncap2
   http://nco.sf.net/src/nco-3.1.9-1.i386.rpm
   (Thanks to Harry Mangalam for installing an up-to-date Fedora
   system for us to build on). 

F. We've recently presented two posters (AGU) and three talks (AMS and
   Opendap conf.) on NCO and the Server-side system now called SWAMP.
   NCO publications, extended abstracts, and posters are at:

Build/runtime changes:

1. Update to DAP for netCDF 3.6.2

2. Allow specification of ANTLR_INC to configure, improve AIX linkage

Enjoy,
Charlie
