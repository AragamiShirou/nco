The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release coincides with a user-friendly version of SWAMP, the 
Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing. SWAMP efficiently
schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote data servers:

http://swamp.googlecode.com

SWAMP can work with with any command-line operator analysis scripts-- 
not just NCO. If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your
client before you can analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up.
Give it a try and give us some feedback.

A. SWAMP released! Visit Daniel at Fall AGU poster IN11B-0469

B. Use ncecat -u ulm_nm to specify the new record dimension name

C. Fix for autoconf builds using GCC on AIX 

D. ncap2 supports OpenMP on most independent branches (Henry Butowsky)
   Demonstration scripts ~/nco/data/[bin_cnt.nco,psd_wrf.nco]

E. Support GCC 4.2 OpenMP (GOMP) in bld/Makefile (not yet configure)
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#openmp

F. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.

H. The NCO scaling paper is out in IJHPCA:

I. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.2 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8 beta2 
   and netCDF4 snapshot20070822 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
