The netCDF operators NCO version 3.2.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.2.0 contains new documentation, new ncap2 features,
and better configure support for IRIX.

A. New ncks feature to control copying attributes to output files.
   Formerly there was no way to append a variable from in.nc to out.nc
   without bringing its metadata and all global metadata with it. 
   Now ncks copies the only metadata that it would print.
   ncks -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy variable and global metadata
   ncks -A -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy variable but not global metadata
   ncks -O -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy variable but not global metadata
   ncks -O -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy global but not variable metadata

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standar grids, e.g., 2D grids 
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grd

D. ncks reports input file type, e.g., NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC, NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4

E. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
   Henry has ...
   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

F. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   "apt-get install nco" also retrieves these versions

G. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available, e.g.,
   http://nco.sf.net/src/nco-3.2.0-1.i386.rpm

Enjoy,
Charlie
