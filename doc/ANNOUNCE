This release supports powerful new ncap2 features such as array
initialization:

defdim("lon",4);a1[$lon]={0,90,180,270};

Build/runtime changes:

1. Support array initialization in ncap2
   
2. Update netCDF4 support to alpha16

3. Quiet output of common ncks and ncatted operations to reduce user paranoia
