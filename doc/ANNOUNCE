A. Memory management to improve threading (Henry Butowsky)

B. Fix Solaris configure problem with _POSIX_SOURCE

C. ncatted workaround for netCDF4 _FillValue (Henry Butowsky)
   ncatted can now change _FillValue on netCDF4 files

D. Disable OpenMP on netCDF4/HDF5-enabled operators.

E. Fix problem with 2D coordinate variables fxm

E. Pre-built Debian Sid & Ubuntu Hardy packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

F. Pre-built RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

G. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote servers: 

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up. 
   Try SWAMP give us your feedback.

H. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.6 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8 final
   and netCDF4 snapshot2008022009 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
