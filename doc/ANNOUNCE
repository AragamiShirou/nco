The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.6 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release 

Also worth mentioning is that the latest Debian (Sid) and Ubuntu
(Maverick) packages finally support DAP, netCDF4, and UDUnits2.

Work on NCO 4.0.7 is underway. 
Areas of improvement include DAP transparency, and more chunking rulesets.

"New stuff" in 4.0.6 details:

A. (fxm) Known problem triggered by using the stride argument when
   accessing some files through some DAP servers. 
   We are working to identify and fix the cause of this problem.

A. C/C99 components of NCO (everything except ncap2) are clang-compliant.
   Compiling NCO with the clang compiler produces correct results.

A. Correctly average YYYYMMDD-format integer "date" variables.
   Thanks to Jeff Daily for reporting this problem.
   The bug only affects the "date" variable in CCSM/CF-compliant files
   with "date", "nbdate", and "time" variables. 
   That's how finicky some metadata conventions are.

A. Lengthy messages about setting threads have been quieted

A. MPI executables mpncbo, mpncecat, mpnflint have been updated to
   the same feature set as the normal, non-MPI executables. (fxm)

A. ncpdq warns when _FillValue is outside range of packed type

"Sticky" reminders:

J. All operators support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More useful chunking patterns may be implemented in NCO 4.0.6.

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Lucid packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

N. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.6 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4-patch1 and with
   4.1.2-beta2-snapshot2010101108
   NCO may not build with earlier, and should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.6 takes advantage of an
   internal change to the netCDF nc_def_var_chunking() API in June 2009. 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make all;make ncap2 # Old Makefile mechanism

O. Have you seen the NCO logo candidates by Tony Freeman, Rich
   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?

Enjoy,

GSL functions added to ncap2 in 4.0.6: 
    none!
(Most desired GSL functions have been merged)
