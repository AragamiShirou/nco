The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.8 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version extends the GSL-library functions supported to
include the GSL statistics routines in GSL Chapter 20.
A list of ncap2 GSL functions added since 3.9.7 is below.

Work on 4.0.0 is underway. Areas of improvement include
more flexible netCDF4 chunking support, better UDUnits2 time support, 
and GSL interpolation and fitting.

"New stuff" details:

A. NCO (when enabled with netCDF4) supports new chunk_size option:
   ncks --cnk_sz 1024,1024,1024 in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#chunking

B. ncks has new -f option (thanks to Denis Nadeau) fxm

C. ncks --secret prints hidden/unsupported options

J. GSL random number and distribution functions
   ncap2 -v -O -s 'defdim("dmn",100);sigma[dmn]=1.0;var=gsl_ran_gaussian(sigma).sort();nbr_neg=(var<0).total();print(var);print(nbr_neg)' ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc

"Sticky" reminders:

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Intrepid packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Find/add NCO tips and tricks on the NCO Wiki:

   http://nco.wiki.sourceforge.net

N. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

O. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 3.9.8 with was built and tested with HDF5 1.8.2-post6 and with
   netCDF4 4.1-beta1-snapshot2009050200.   

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

P. Did you see the NCO logo candidate submitted by Tony Freeman?
   What do you think? Should it replace the mandleblob?
