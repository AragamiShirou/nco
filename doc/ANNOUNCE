The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.9.0 supports Lempel-Ziv deflation for netCDF4, 
contains a fix for building ncap2 with Intel compilers,
and fixes RPM-building on hybrid 32/64-bit systems.

Compression/deflation with netCDF4:
Our unscientific testing shows that maximum deflation compresses
typical climate datasets by 30-40%. Here's how to convert a netCDF3
dataset to a (deflated) netCDF4 dataset: 

ncks -O -4 -L 9 in.nc out.nc # Deflate file

Or, pack _and_ deflate files to save even more space:

ncpdq -O -4 -L 9 in.nc out.nc # Pack and deflate file

B. --fl_fmt switch supports converting netCDF4->netCDF3

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standard grids, e.g., 2D grids

D. Build RPMs correctly for hybrid 32/64-bit OSs (e.g., RHEL, Rocks)
   Thanks to Daniel Wang for this patch

E. Improve ncap2 missing_value handling and RAM variables (Henry Butowsky) 

F. ncap2 supports loops! (Henry Butowsky)

G. Fix bug with ncap2 built with Intel compilers
   Thanks to Remik Ziemlinski for his excellent bug reports!

H. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.

I. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

J. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   To build NCO with netCDF4 support, you must build with netCDF4
   snapshot2007060701 or newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
