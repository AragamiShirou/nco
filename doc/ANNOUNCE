The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.4 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version contains several improvements and ... no bug-fixes.
That's right, after two minor releases, 4.0.2 and 4.0.3, that
comprised mostly bug fixes, the only problems left to fix in 4.0.4
were minor or could generously be called "features". New stuff:

Chunking is now supported on all relevant operators, i.e., all except
ncrename and ncatted. ncap2, moreover, now propagates deflation, and
tries to propagate chunking options, through derived expressions.
ncpdq now tries to avoid packing grid properties like coordinates.
Metadata printed by ncks is now re-formatted, expanded, and simpler.
Scripts that depend on the exact format of ncks output may break.
Let us know if this causes you major heartburn and, if so, we will
consider implementing an option to restore the previous format.

Work on NCO 4.0.5 is underway. Areas of improvement include
Support for spectral transforms, more chunking rulesets (fxm)

"New stuff" in 4.0.4 details:

A. Chunking supported in all operators.
   The exception is ncap2, which propagates chunking from fixed
   and copied variables, but not from algebraic expressions.
   (This capability may be in the next version.)

A. Stricter checks to identify malformed user-input strings.
   Issue more informative warnings, hints, and errors when detected.

A. ncecat, and all other operators, now retain the input deflation
   level, if any, for a variable, as the default for the output file.
   
A. ncks -m now always summarizes metadata on chunking, compression, and packing
   Moreover, it prints metadata with clearer English descriptions

A. Prior versions of ncrename -a .old_nm,new_nm in.nc out.nc
   would, if old_nm did not exist, write the correct file then exit
   with an error message although no error had occurred.

A. MacIntosh users who do not use MacPorts can install NCO binaries
   by clicking on an Apple Disk Image (.dmg) file.
   Thanks to Chad Cantwell of UCI.

A. Deflation level (--dfl_lvl) propagates into ncap2 derived variables 
   Thanks to Henry Butowsky.

A. ncpdq no longer packs grid properties such as coordinate variables,
   CF "special variables, or weights. Rationale: Coordinate variables
   are 1D, so packing saves little space, and the resulting files are
   difficult for humans to read. Similarly, Gaussian and area weights 
   are often used to multiply other variables in re-inflated
   (unpacked) files. Packing such weights causes a considerable loss
   of precision in the result. If users wish to pack such variables,
   we could implement new packing policies that explicitly packs
   coordinates and weighting variables. We welcome your feedback. A
   workaround for those needing to  pack such variables now, is to use
   the packing functions in ncap2, or to rename the grid properties
   prior to calling ncpdq.

"Sticky" reminders:

J. ncks and ncecat support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More useful chunking patterns may be implemented in NCO 4.0.4.

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Karmic packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

N. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.4 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4-patch1 and with
   netCDF4 4.1.2-beta1-snapshot2010080820
   NCO may not build with earlier, and should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.4 takes advantage of an
   internal change to the netCDF nc_def_var_chunking() API in June 2009. 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?

GSL functions added to ncap2 in 4.0.4: 
    none!
(Most desired GSL functions have been merged)
