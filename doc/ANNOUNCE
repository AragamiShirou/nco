The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.9 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

There are two significant new changes in this version.

1. ncbo now supports threading.
Manually configure threading with -t (as with ncra, ncpdq, ncea), or
ncbo will pick a default for you.

2. ncpdq has powerful packing capabilities
ncpdq stands for "Permute Dimensions Quickly" and now "Pack Data
Quickly" too. 
Prior to this release, ncap sported the only packing features in NCO.
However, ncap only packs one variable at a time.
ncpdq is more consistent with the NCO file-at-a-time paradigm.
To pack the entire file in.nc into output file out.nc use

ncpdq -P all_new in.nc out.nc

The main options to -P are 
  all_new: Pack all unpacked variables and re-pack all packed variables
  all_xst: Pack all unpacked variables and do not touch packed variables
  upk: Unpack all packed variables
This basic packing reduces the size of the average floating point file
by a factor of two with no additional work on the user's part.
One nice feature of (lossy) scale_factor/add_offset packing is that
additional, loss-less packing algorithms can layer on top of it.

Right now, ncpdq picks the packing type (e.g., NC_SHORT) for you.
The next version will introduce options for more fine-grained control.
Caveats: Packing tends to remove the utility of missing_values.
The interaction of packing and missing_values is hard to handle.
I am reluctant to implement any such features until/unless multiple
users agree on the most useful features and specifically request
them. So the ball is your court.

Enjoy,
Charlie
