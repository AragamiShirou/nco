The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.6 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version has been "extensively" tested with netCDF4.0.
We tried to make sure that NCO produces the same output 
regardless of the back-end library (netCDF3 or netCDF4) and
filetype (netCDF3 or netCDF4).
This was not trivial because of differences in the ways the
two libraries handling of, e.g., threading, and _FillValue's. 

Thank you NSF for funding NCO from 20040901 through 20080831.
We will finish the projects already in the pipeline.
This includes an NCO 4.0 once a few details are cleared up, and, 
hopefully, tinstalling SWAMP on the NCAR Community Data Portal.

Thanks to Tom Roche, NCO now has a Wiki

http://nco.wiki.sourceforge.net

Including a site for new "NCO Hacks", i.e., usage examples:

http://nco.wiki.sourceforge.net/Cookbook

Please give it a try!

A. Memory management to improve threading (Henry Butowsky)

B. Fix Solaris configure problem with _POSIX_SOURCE

C. ncatted workaround for netCDF4 _FillValue (Henry Butowsky)
   ncatted can now change _FillValue on netCDF4 files

D. Disable OpenMP on netCDF4/HDF5-enabled operators
   It is too difficult for the NCO "configure" apparatus to determine
   whether the underlying libraries (HDF5, netCDF4) support OpenMP.
   So, for now, we assume they do not.

E. ncra does not attempt to average record variables of type NC_CHAR

E. ncap2 supports #include files, syntax is #include "pi.nco" 

E. CF-convention "coordinates" attribute strings with excessive whitespace work

E. Pre-built Debian Sid & Ubuntu Hardy packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

E. ncap2 correctly propogates missing values through expressions with
   constant operands

F. Pre-built RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

G. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote servers: 

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up. 
   Try SWAMP give us your feedback.

H. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.6 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8 final
   and netCDF4 final and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
