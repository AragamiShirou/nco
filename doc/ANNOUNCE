The netCDF operators NCO version 3.2.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.2.1 contains functional (though limited) netCDF4 support,
improved attribute copying, new documentation, new ncap2 features, 
and better IRIX support.
This release _requires_ netCDF 3.6.1 or newer to build correctly.
Because the netCDF4 support description is extensive its description
appears at the end of this announcement. 
The netCDF3 NCO improvements in 3.2.1 are:

A. ncks copying of variable and global metadata is configurable (-m, -M).
   Formerly there was no way to append a variable from in.nc to out.nc
   without bringing its metadata and all global metadata with it. 
   ncks -A           in.nc out.nc # Append variable and global attributes
   ncks -O           in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -v one       in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -O -v one    in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -A -v one    in.nc out.nc # Append variable not global attributes
   ncks -A -M -v one in.nc out.nc # Append variable not global attributes
   ncks -O -M -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable not global attributes
   ncks -O -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   global not variable attributes
   ncks -O -M -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   data only, no attributes
   ncks -A    -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Append data only, no attributes
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#prn has more details.

B. GCC 4.2 compatibility: This is untested. However, we're eager to
   whether the OpenMP works for those who build NCO with GCC 4.2.

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standard grids, e.g., 2D grids 
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grd

D. ncks reports input file type (e.g., NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC,
   NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4) as part of global metadata

E. Fix ncap2 .total() method to correctly handle missing_values fxm

F. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
   Henry has ...
   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

G. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   "apt-get install nco" also retrieves these versions

H. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available, e.g.,
   http://nco.sf.net/src/nco-3.2.0-1.i386.rpm

Finally, what to expect with NCO support for netCDF4:
Support for netCDF4 features will be incremental, i.e., 
we'll add one netCDF4 feature at a time to NCO.
You must build NCO with netCDF4 to obtain this support.
There is no reason that we know of _not_ to build with netCDF4 now. 

The main netCDF4 features that NCO currently supports are the new 
atomic data types (ubyte, ushort, uint, int64, and uint64).
The eight-byte integer support may be especially helpful to you.
All NCO operators support these types, e.g., ncks prints them,
ncra averages them, and ncap2 scripts with them.

netCDF4-enabled NCO handles netCDF3 files without change.
In addition, it automagically handles netCDF4 (HDF) files:
If you feed NCO netCDF3 files, it produces netCDF3 output.
If you feed NCO netCDF4 files, it produces netCDF4 output.
Use the handy-dandy -4 switch to request netCDF4 output from 
netCDF3 input, i.e., to convert netCDF3 to netCDF4.

netCDF4 is beta software:
Problems with the netCDF4 and HDF libraries are still being fixed.
NCO support for netCDF4 atomic types is relatively untested.
The binary distributions (RPMs and debs) still use netCDF3 for now.
If you want the netCDF4 support, you'll have to build NCO yourself:

Make sure your library and include paths point to the netCDF4-beta1
installation and use your preferred NCO build mechanism with either
 
configure --enable-netcdf4 

or

cd ~/nco/bld;make NETCDF4=Y allinone 

Our short term goal is to track the netCDF4-beta releases, keep the
new netCDF4 atomic type support working, and iron out any problems.
Our long term goal is to utilize more of the extensive new netCDF4
feature set. The next major netCDF4 feature we are likely to utilize
is parallel I/O. We will enable this in the MPI netCDF operators.

Enjoy,
Charlie
