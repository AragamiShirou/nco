The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco/nco.tar.gz (new location)

There is one notable change since version 2.7.4:

1. The new netCDF Binary Operator (ncbo) does file addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. ncbo obsoletes ncdiff.
ncdiff is now symobolically linked to the ncbo executable.
User's who wish to continue using ncdiff should notice no difference.
ncdiff is identical to ncbo --op_typ=sub.

2. Rumors that ncap would eat ncwa proved premature.

Enjoy,
Charlie
