The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.8 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

A. ncwa bugfix: 
   ncwa reported NaN/inf for minimization/maximization/summation of
   coordinate variables. This has been fixed.

A. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.

B. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available
and they include ncap2. Get them directly with "apt-get install nco".
Other users, e.g., Ubuntu, get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
We plan to add ncap2 to RPM packages in 3.1.9.

C. Three extended abstracts describe new results with Distributed Data 
Reduction and Analysis using NCO. We will present these at the 
San Francisco AGU conference in December, and at the San Antonio AMS
IIPC conference in January (with newer results---come say "Hi!").
All NCO publications, extended abstracts, and posters are at:  

http://nco.sf.net#pub

Build/runtime changes:

1. Warn when ((_FillValue is) and (missing_value is not)) defined

2. Compile-time option to treat _FillValue (instead of missing_value) as missing

3. Debian/Ubuntu packages include ncap2

Enjoy,
Charlie
