The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.1 are ready.

This release eradicates some old but newly discovered ncap bugs.
ncap incorrectly handled division, modulo, and exponentiation of the
form S/V, S%V, and S^V where first operand was scalar and second was
a full variable. Full details of the bug are at 

http://nco.sf.net/index.shtml#bug_ncap_cmt.

The V/V, V%V, V^V,  V/S, V%S, V^S, S/S, S%S, and S^S operations were
never affected. 
We recommend that all ncap users upgrade to version 2.9.2.

Solaris autotools problems have been resolved.
NCO builds fine with up-to-date bison's (e.g., version 1.875+).

Enjoy,
Charlie
