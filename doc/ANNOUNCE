The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

First, the NCO licenses have changed from GPL2 (code) and FDL1.1
(documentation) to GPL3 (code) and FDL1.2 (documentation).

Second, 3.9.2 also introduces support for UDUnits2 and 
ncap2 printing and type-conversion. As usual the latest build
and compile tweaks have been made to improve portability.

Finally, the major user-visible change is that the default attribute  
if any, specifying the value of data to ignore has (finally) changed 
from "missing_value" to "_FillValue".
Supporting both of these attributes simultaneously is not practical.
Hence the behavior NCO used to apply to missing_value's now applies to
_FillValue's---missing_value's are now treated as normal data. 

It has been and remains most advisable to create both _FillValue
and missing_value attributes with identical values in datasets.
Nevertheless, many legacy datasets contain on "missing_value".
Here are two commands that will help migrating datasets.

# Rename all missing_value attributes to _FillValue
ncrename -a .missing_value,_FillValue inout.nc

# Add _FillValue attribute to all variables
ncatted -O -a _FillValue,,o,f,1.0e36 inout.nc

The old functionality, i.e., where the ignored values are indicated by
"missing_value" not "_FillValue", may be selected _at build time_ by 
compiling NCO with the token definition 

CPPFLAGS='-DNCO_MSS_VAL_SNG=missing_value'

C. New Documentation:

D. 

E. ncap2 continues to grow more powerful (Henry Butowsky)
   Demonstration scripts ~/nco/data/[bin_cnt.nco,psd_wrf.nco]   

F. ncap2 supports type conversion (Henry Butowsky)
   ncap2 -s 'big_int=uint64(small_int)+double(small_int);' in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2 

G. ncap2 now prints variables and metadata (Henry Butowsky)
   ncap2 -s 'foo=1;print(foo)' in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2 

H. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

I. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

J. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO 3.9.2 with netCDF4 support has only been built and tested 
   with HDF5 1.8 beta2 and netCDF4 snapshot20070727 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
