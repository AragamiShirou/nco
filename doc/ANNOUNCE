The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.8 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)

This release mainly implements some overlooked ncap operations. 
ncap modulo operator (A%B) and generic exponentiation (A^B) work in
all combinations.

fxm: Solaris cc/CC autotools builds have been broken since ~2.8.6, too.
If anyone would care to send a patch that would be great!

Enjoy,
Charlie
