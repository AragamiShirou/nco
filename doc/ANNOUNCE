The netCDF operators NCO version 2.7.4 are ready.

There are two notable changes since version 2.7.3:

1. Improvements to AIX support, especially autotools support.
Contributed by Jim Edwards of NCAR. Thanks, Jim!
2. Fix limit parsing so hyperslabs specified in floating point format
do not confuse UDUnits interface layer. This resulted in core dumps
(but not wrong answers) in 2.7.3. Fixed by Rorik Peterson.

Plans are for the next release (2.8.0) to contain full integration
with Debian Linux, and to settle rumors that ncap may eat ncwa.

Enjoy,
Charlie
