The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.2 are ready. 
They contain an noteworthy bugfix for packed data, an important change
in behavior for ncea/ncra/ncwa, and significant new features in ncap2.

ncap2 is the successor to ncap. Henry Butowsky's work to address some
of the arithmetic limitations of ncap is beginning to pay off.
ncap2 now handles array syntax, if/then constructs and much more.
ncap2 is still a bit alpha, but ready to be tested for functionality.
The sample script nco/data/ncap2.in demonstrates its features.
