The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.2 are ready.

There are two notable feature improvement since version 2.8.1:

1. When input variables for ncbo binary operations have distinct
missing_value's, NCO now does the best job possible to ensure that 
all missing_value's in both operands retain the missing_value
characteristic. Formerly, it was possible for missing values in 
one variable to be treated as valid data.
2. Improve error messages and hints for out of range problems

There are a few minor packaging fixes:
1. Do not distribute ncap_lex.c, ncap_yacc.[ch] in tarball

Enjoy,
