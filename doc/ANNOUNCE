The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.4.6 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release is mainly a bugfix and stability release. 
It fixes the promotion of packed records with missing values.
It is likely that affected users would have noticed the incorrect
values caused by this bug.

Work on NCO 4.4.7 is underway, still focused on stability and speed.   
This includes more netCDF4 mop-up and new chunking features.

Enjoy,
Charlie

NEW FEATURES (full details always in ChangeLog):

A. ncap2 command-line and script arguments can now both be specified
   AND executed. Command-line args are executed before script:
   ncap2 -v -s "lon=${longitude}" -S in_4.nc out.nc
   This is useful for passing shell variables into NCO scripts.
   Pass the shell variables with -s and the -S scripts will use them.
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2

A. ncks -V = --var_val is new switch to print only variable values.
   Compare and contrast -Q, -V, and --no_nm_prn:
   % ncks -v three_dmn_rec_var -C -H in.nc
   time[0]=1 lat[0]=-90 lon[0]=0 three_dmn_rec_var[0]=1 
   % ncks --no_nm_prn -v three_dmn_rec_var -C -H in.nc
   1 -90 0 1
   % ncks -Q -v three_dmn_rec_var -C -H in.nc              
   three_dmn_rec_var[0]=1 
   % ncks -Q --no_nm_prn -v three_dmn_rec_var -C -H in.nc
   1
   % ncks -V -v three_dmn_rec_var -C -H in.nc
   1

BUG FIXES:

A. NCO now checks correct function to enable DAP with configure.
   NCO has been checking the wrong function to see if netCDF was
   enabled with DAP support since about NCO 4.3.1 (May 2013).
   Thanks to Parker Norton and Filipe Fernandes for reporting this. 

A. Fix --file_format switch as synonym for --fl_fmt
   Thanks to Dave Allured for reporting this.

A. Fix promotion of packed variables with missing values. 
   Versions 4.3.X-4.4.5 of ncra could produce (wildly) inaccurate
   statistics when promoting (e.g., to double- from single-precision)
   variables that are packed and that have missing values.
   The two workarounds are to remove the scaling or to perform the
   statistics in single precision with the --flt option.
   The solution is to upgrade to NCO 4.4.6.

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO NCO:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.4.6 built/tested with netCDF
   4.3.3-rc1 on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.13 with these methods: 

   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem?)
   ncra/ncrcat (not ncks) hyperslabbing can fail on variables with multiple record dimensions

   Demonstration:
   ncrcat -O -d time,0 ~/nco/data/mrd.nc ~/foo.nc

   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140619: Problem reported by rmla
   Cause: Unsure. Maybe ncra.c loop structure not amenable to MRD?
   Workaround: Convert to fixed dimensions then hyperslab

C. NOT YET FIXED (NCO or netCDF problem? Unsure)
   Specifying strided hyperslab on netCDF4 datasets leads
   to enormous slowdown or failure with recent NCO versions.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -d time,0,,12 ~/ET_2000-01_2001-12.nc ~/foo.nc

   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140718: Problem reported by Parker Norton
   Cause: Unclear. Interaction of stride and MSA?
   Workaround: Convert file to netCDF3 first, then use stride

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO BASE LIBRARIES/PROTOCOLS:

A. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF library problem)
   Probe hidden attributes (chunking, compression) of HDF4 files

   Demonstration:
   ncdump -h -s ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (dies)
   ncks -m ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (works by avoiding fatal calls)

   20131230: Verified problem still exists

   Cause: some libnetCDF library functions fail on HDF4 file inquiries.
   Bug report filed: netCDF #HZY-708311 ncdump/netCDF4 segfaults probing HDF4 file
   Tracking tickets NCF-272, NCF-273

B. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug report filed: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails
