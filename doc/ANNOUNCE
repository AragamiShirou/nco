The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.4.5 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release is mainly a bugfix and stability release. 
A few new features improve some corner-cases:
NCO now accesses DAP files on HTTPS servers.

Work on NCO 4.4.6 is underway, still focused on stability and speed.   
This includes more netCDF4 mop-up, improved group broadcasting
algorithms, and, possibly, improved HDF4 support, and new chunking 
features.

Enjoy,
Charlie

NEW FEATURES (full details always in ChangeLog):

A. NCO now accesses DAP files on HTTPS servers. Previously NCO would
   only test filenames beginning with "http://" for DAP access. Now
   NCO also tests filenames beginning with "https://" for DAP access.

A. ncks --grp_xtr_var_xcl: Group Extraction Variable Exclusion
   This new switch helps control variable and group extraction.
   Normally NCO works in "intersection mode" where the objects
   extracted are the intersection of arguments to -g and -v.
   And the --union switch can be used to make their union.
   What about 
   fxm

BUG FIXES:

A. Hi

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.4.5 built/tested with netCDF
   4.3.3-rc1 on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.12 with these methods: 

   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF library problem)
   Probe hidden attributes (chunking, compression) of HDF4 files

   Demonstration:
   ncdump -h -s ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (dies)
   ncks -m ~/nco/data/hdf.hdf # (works by avoiding fatal calls)

   20131230: Verified problem still exists

   Cause: some libnetCDF library functions fail on HDF4 file inquiries.
   Bug report filed: netCDF #HZY-708311 ncdump/netCDF4 segfaults probing HDF4 file
   Tracking tickets NCF-272, NCF-273

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug report filed: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

D. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails
