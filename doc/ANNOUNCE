The netCDF operators NCO version 1.2.2 are ready. 
User-visible improvements to version 1.2.1 include a few new 
features for ncks, ncrename, and ncwa and one bugfix.
Get the new version and read the user's guide on

http://nco.sourceforge.net

Summary of changes:

1. ncrename handles specific variables rather than whole file (Butowsky)
2. Weights work with <tt>ncwa</tt> in min/max/ttl operations (Zender)
3. make HDF4=Y simplifies building HDF-enabled NCO 

Enjoy,
Charlie
