The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.7 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

ncpdq is a new operator which re-shapes variables and files.
ncpdq behaves like ncwa in most respects, except ncpdq re-arranges
values in variables rather than averages them.  
For example,

ncpdq -a lon,lat in.nc out.nc

writes out.nc after permuting dimensions, where necessary, to ensure
that lat follows lon in all variables. 
ncpdq alters the identity of the record dimension, where necessary.

ncpdq also reverses dimensions if asked, e.g.,

ncpdq -a -lat in.nc out.nc

The meaning of "pdq" in ncpdq is not settled.
The "p" may mean permute or pack, the "d" may mean dimension, and
the "q" allows later expansion of whatever it is :)
None of the existing operators was well suited for modification to
handle re-shaping all the variables in a file, so I designed ncpdq
to provide a good structure for operations (such as re-shaping,
reversal) which do not alter variable rank. 
Placing packing/unpacking functions (already in ncap) in ncpdq, so
that all the variables in a file can be packed with one commend,
should now be straightforward and is now on the wish list.

fxm First, AIX NCO installations should upgrade to this version to get the 
AIX-specific ncap bug-fix. 

Enjoy,
Charlie
