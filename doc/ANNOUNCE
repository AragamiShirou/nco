The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version offers many minor fixes and improvements.
Short explanations of these appear below.

Additionally, Debian/Ubuntu users should note that the bleeding-edge
NCO features are available in Debian package format long before
official releases. For example, the .deb package for this 4.0.2
release have been in the periodically 

Work on NCO 4.0.3 is underway. Areas of improvement include
Support for spectral transforms, chunking in all operators,
more chunking rulesets.

"New stuff" in 4.0.2 details:

A. Fix off-by-one error in ncatted appends for type NC_CHAR
   Extra NULs are no longer inserted with each append
   Thanks to A.T. Wittenburg for this bug report.

B. Warn on deflation (compression) attempts if fl_fmt != NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4.
   Commands like "ncks -L 9 --fl_fmt=netcdf4_classic in.nc out.nc"
   will still attempt to complete without deflation, but will warn.

H. Known Problem: 
   Namespace collision between mvapich2, netCDF4, and NCO when netCDF
   (4.1) is compiled with parallel HDF5 (1.8.4). Thanks to anonymous
   for pointing this out. We are working on it!

"Sticky" reminders:

J. ncks and ncecat support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More useful chunking patterns may be implemented in NCO 4.0.2.
   ncks -O -4 --cnk_plc=all in.nc out.nc

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Karmic packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

N. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.2 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4 and with
   netCDF4 netcdf-4.1-snapshot2009111500.
   NCO may not build with earlier, but should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.2 takes advantage of
   an internal change to the netCDF API in June 2009 for
   nc_def_var_chunking(). 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

O. Have you seen the NCO logo candidates by Tony Freeman, Rich
   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?

Enjoy,
