The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version contains many minor fixes and improvements.
Short explanations of these appear below.

Work on NCO 4.0.4 is underway. Areas of improvement include
Support for spectral transforms, chunking in all operators,
more chunking rulesets.

"New stuff" in 4.0.3 details:

A. Allow for sensing, handling MAC OS X on x86_64 chips
   Thanks to drkdev for solving this problem

A. Configure works better with ncap2, netCDF4, UDUnits2, and netCDF-DAP

"Sticky" reminders:

J. ncks and ncecat support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More useful chunking patterns may be implemented in NCO 4.0.3.

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Karmic packages:

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:

M. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

N. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.3 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4 and with
   netCDF4 netcdf-4.1-snapshot2009111500.
   NCO may not build with earlier, and should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.3 takes advantage of an
   internal change to the netCDF nc_def_var_chunking() API in June 2009. 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

O. Have you seen the NCO logo candidates by Tony Freeman, Rich
   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?

Enjoy,

GSL functions added to ncap2 in 4.0.3: 
    none!
(Most desired GSL functions have been merged)
