The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.1 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)

Release 3.9.1 supports netCDF4/HDF Lempel-Ziv deflation
and contains multiple fixes for building NCO and ncap2 
for various compilers (including Intel) and OSs.

Compression/deflation with netCDF4-enabled NCO:
Our unscientific testing shows that maximum deflation compresses
typical climate datasets by 30-40%. Here's how to convert a netCDF3
dataset to a (deflated) netCDF4 dataset: 

ncks  -O -4 -L 9 in.nc out.nc # Deflate file (slow)

Or, pack files (with lossy algorithm) to compress ~50%:

ncpdq -O in.nc out.nc # Pack file (fast)

Or, pack _and_ deflate files to squeeze datasets by ~80%!:

ncpdq -O -4 -L 9 in.nc out.nc # Pack and deflate (slower)

B. --fl_fmt switch supports converting netCDF4->netCDF3

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standard grids, e.g., 2D grids

D. Build RPMs correctly for hybrid 32/64-bit OSs (e.g., RHEL, Rocks)
   Thanks to Daniel Wang for this patch

E. Improve ncap2 missing_value handling and RAM variables (Henry Butowsky) 

F. ncap2 supports loops! (Henry Butowsky)

G. Fix bug with ncap2 built with Intel compilers
   Thanks to Remik Ziemlinski for his excellent bug reports!

H. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.

I. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

J. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   To build NCO 3.9.1 with netCDF4 support, you must build with
   netCDF4 snapshot2007060701 or newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
