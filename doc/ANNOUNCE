The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.5 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release supports the stride argument for all dimensions for all
hyperslabbing operators. Formerly, only ncks offered full stride
support for all dimensions. 

This release has new features only for ncap2. Henry Butowsky has ...

ncap2 -s 'defdim("x",64);x[x]=1.0;x(::2)=0' in.nc out.nc

Many more examples are in http://nco.sf.net/ncap2.in

Those interested in NCO internals might want to read two submitted
manuscripts which describe NCO and its scaling. These are at

Build/runtime changes:

1. Support stride in all dimensions for all hyperslabbing operators 

2. Reduce severity of inter-file non-monotonicity from WARNING to INFO
   Intended to lower user's blood pressure 

fxm. Improve Pathscale pathcc/pathCC support (bld/Makefile and autoconf)

fxm. Improve PGI pgcc/pgCC support (bld/Makefile and autoconf)

fxm. Improve Intel icc/icpc support (bld/Makefile and autoconf)
