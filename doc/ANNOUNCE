The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.5 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release improves NCO build-ability/configuration.
Most notably we updated and simplified support for DODS.
See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#DODS for more info.
We hope more users will take advantage of the network-transparent data 
access capabilities of DODS by building NCO as DODS clients, e.g.,

ncwa -O -C -a lat,lon,time -d lon,-10.,10. -d lat,-10.,10. -l ./ -p \
http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nph-nc/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis.dailyavgs/surface \
air.sig995.1975.nc foo.nc

Why use your local CPU when you can slow down a remote DODS server
instead? :)  

Thanks to Rorik and Henry for their continuing contributions.

Enjoy,
Charlie

Bug-fixes:
1. make install works on Solaris. Used to die with symlinks. (Rorik)
2. Changing attribute values with ncap works as advertised (Henry)

Feature changes:
1. -r switch prints compile-time configuration for all operators
2. Build with ./configure --enable-optimize-custom, if possible, 
   for best performance (Charlie)

Other user-visible changes:
1. Build procedure assumes DODS v. 3.4+ is installed (Rorik)
   Building with DODS v. 3.3- is no longer supported
   doc/dods.sh guides DODS installation prior to building NCO 
2. Added and renamed options to ./configure script

User-invisible changes:
1. Improved type-checking/safety/casting in all routines allows most
   code to build warning-free with --enable-debug-custom
