The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.3 are ready. 
They contain a fix for empty record variables, improved CF Convention
support, and significant new features in ncwa and ncap2.

ncap2 is the successor to ncap. Henry Butowsky's work to address some
of the arithmetic limitations of ncap is beginning to pay off.
ncap2 now handles array syntax, if/then constructs and much more.
ncap2 is still a bit alpha, but ready to be tested for functionality.
The sample script nco/data/ncap2.in demonstrates its features.

1. ncap2 attribute propagation (Henry Butowsky)

   Defining new variables in terms of existing variables is one of
   ncap2's most powerful features.
   Derived fields inherit the metadata (i.e., attributes) of their
   identically named ancestors, if any, in the script or input file. 
   When the derived field is completely new (no identically-named ancestors
   exist), then it inherits the metadata (if any) of the left-most variable
   on the right hand side of the defining expression.
   Reminder: ncap2 depends on ANTLR to build so do, e.g., 
   sudo apt-get install antlr libantlr-dev 
   before running NCO's configure

2. ncap2 LHS array logic working (Henry Butowsky)

3. Support CF convention on "coordinates" attribute:

   Coordinates listed in "coordinates" attribute "stick" to the
   parent variable just like real coordinates.

4. ncwa -b retains degenerate dimensions

5. ncwa -B mask_condition option

6. Work (or die) "correctly" with zero-record record variables
   All record variables are zero-length prior to the storage of data.
   Apparently having zero-length record variables is a valid state for a 
   netCDF file. NCO now works "correctly" on such files.
   I say "correctly" because this is somewhat subjective.
   The only clearly bizarre behavior I am aware of is that averaging
   a zero-record record variable over the record dimension with ncwa 
   creates a scalar, i.e., a variable with no dimensions. 
   Scalars must have one element, so the averaged variable has more data
   than the initial variable.  
   The alternative is deleting the variable completely, and I thought
   retaining the metadata would be preferable. 
   This behavior may change in the future.

7. Build fixes for Solaris, Cygwin, NECSX and Cray

8. Support netcdf4-alpha14

Enjoy,
