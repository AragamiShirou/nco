Rorik fixed a bug due to over-zealous use of GCC compile options.
This bug has occurred since 2.86. whenever
--enable-[optimize/debug]-custom was invoked with gcc.

Solaris cc/CC autotools builds have been broken since ~2.8.6, too.
If anyone would care to send a patch that would be great!

Enjoy,
Charlie

Bug-fixes:
1. Remove -fshort-enums: Make enums as short as possible, ususally
non-int. Do not ever invoke this! This breaks ABI and causes subtle
problems

Feature changes:
1. None

Other user-visible changes:
1. Documented how to do co-variances

User-invisible changes:
1. Fixed a small memory leak, more to follow with valgrind
