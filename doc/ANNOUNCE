The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.1 are ready.

Version 3.0.1 contains mainly build and benchmarking improvements.
The only user-visible change is one more tweak to the default ncks
printing behavior. There is an important bug-fix for ncap so
ncap users should upgrade. 
Threading is much improved and has been enabled on all arithmetic
operators. Users with SMP machines and OpenMP compilers who want
faster processing should upgrade too.

1. ncra bug: Versions < 3.0.2 could produce incorrect answers in
   unusual corner cases involving non-floating-point data and missing
   values spread amongst multiple files.

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam): 
   Additional benchmark verification options: word count, MD5

3. ncap (Henry Butowsky): Memory handling is much cleaner

4. Small additional memory leaks found and fixed in corner cases

5. MPI (Gayathri Venkitachalam): 

6. OpenDAP (Harry Mangalam): Support OPeNDAP version 3.5.0+

Future: We anticipate one more stability-oriented release (3.0.3),
followed by the MPI-enabled NCO (3.1).

Enjoy,
Charlie
