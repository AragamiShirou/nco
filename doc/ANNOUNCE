The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.1 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version offers significant new features:
Chunking in ncks, ncecat, GSL fitting, bilinear interpolation.

Short explanations of these appear below.

Work on NCO 4.0.1 is underway. Areas of improvement include
Support for spectral transforms, chunking in all operators,
more chunking rulesets.

"New stuff" in 4.0.1 details:

A. Configure: --enable-netcdf-4 is synonymous with --enable-netcdf4
   Now NCO configure accepts the usage of the netCDF configure.
   According to the Unidata netCDF team, the converse is also true.

A. Fix problems converting netcdf4_classic input files to netcdf3

A. Add ncks --fix_rec_dmn switch to change all record dimensions in 
   in.nc into fixed dimensions in out.nc:
   ncks --fix_rec_dmn in.nc out.nc

A. Fix behavior of ncrename when target (variable/dimension/attribute
   does not exist and name was prefixed with '.'. Used to die messily.
   Correct behavior, now implemented is to skip it with a warning. 
   Thanks to Patrick for reporting this bug.

A. ncks warns when printing packed contents of packed variables

A. Fix erroneous ncbo WARNING about non-duplicated variables fxm
   
C. ncap2 supports the GSL (Chapter 36) least-squares fitting routines, e.g.,
   ncap2 -v -O -s 'defdim("dmn",100);sigma[dmn]=1.0;var1=gsl_ran_gaussian(sigma);var2=gsl_stats_skew(var1);print(var2)' in.nc out.nc
   ncap2 functions added since 3.9.9 are listed below

D. ncks and ncecat support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More usefule chunking patterns will be implemented in NCO 4.0.1.
   ncks -O -4 --cnk_plc=all in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#chunking

E. NCO improves support for the netCDF4 NC_STRING atomic type.
   An "s" trailing double quotes specifies NC_STRING (not NC_CHAR):
   ncap2 -4 -O -v -s 'name[lat]={"US"s,"Them"s};' in.nc out.nc
   Ragged arrays of strings are finally here! Let's use them.

F. Dimension-reduction to scalars works with irregular hyperslabs.
   Commands that now work include
   scalar=avg(three_dmn_var_dbl(0:1,:,0:3));
   scalar=total(three_dmn_var_dbl(0:1,:,0:3)); 
   Formerly these required multiple steps to ensure that the
   intermediate dimension sizes used in the hyperslabs were present 
   on disk. 

G. OpenSuse packages are now available (Filipe Fernandes)

"Sticky" reminders:

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Karmic packages:

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

N. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.1 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4 and with
   netCDF4 netcdf-4.1-snapshot2009111500.
   NCO may not build with earlier, but should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.1 takes advantage of
   an internal change to the netCDF API in June 2009 for
   nc_def_var_chunking(). 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?
