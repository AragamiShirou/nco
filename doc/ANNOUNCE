The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.2 are ready. 
They contain a fix for empty record variables, improved CF Convention
support, and significant new features in ncwa and ncap2.

ncap2 is the successor to ncap. Henry Butowsky's work to address some
of the arithmetic limitations of ncap is beginning to pay off.
ncap2 now handles array syntax, if/then constructs and much more.
ncap2 is still a bit alpha, but ready to be tested for functionality.
The sample script nco/data/ncap2.in demonstrates its features.

All record variables are zero-length prior to the storage of data.
Apparently having zero-length record variables is a valid state for a 
netCDF file. NCO now works "correctly" on such files.
I say "correctly" because this is somewhat subjective.
The only clearly bizarre behavior I am aware of is that averaging
a zero-record record variable over the record dimension with ncwa 
creates a scalar, i.e., a variable with no dimensions. 
Scalars must have one element, so the averaged variable has more data
than the initial variable.  
The alternative is deleting the variable completely, and I thought
retaining the metadata would be preferable. 
This behavior may change in the future.

0. Build fixes for Solaris, Cygwin, NECSX and Cray

1. Support netcdf4-alpha14 (fxm)

2. ncap2 attribute propagation (Henry Butowsky) (fxm)

3. ncap2 LHS array logic working (Henry Butowsky) (fxm)

4. Server-side extensions (Daniel Wang) (fxm)

5. Work (or die) "correctly" with zero-record record variables

6. Support CF convention on "coordinates" attribute:
   Coordinates listed in "coordinates" attribute are stick to the
   parent variable just like real coordinates.

7. ncwa -B mask_condition option

8. ncwa -b retain degenerate dimension

Enjoy,
