The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.2 contains a sprinkling of internal changes (build,
benchmarking, memory usage, and documentation improvements),
new I/O features, and convenience routines for IPCC processing.

1. OpenMP: Only one critical region remains in netCDF reads

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam): Work with OPeNDAP, MPI

3. ncap (Henry Butowsky): Improved memory efficiency

4. MPI (Gayathri Venkitachalam): Beta-version MPI-enabled operators
   mpncflint, mpncecat, mpncwa, mpncpdq, mpncra, mpncrcat, mpncea
   Build them with 'cd ~/nco/bld;make MPI=Y' and run them with mpirun! 

5. OPeNDAP (Harry Mangalam and James Gallagher): 
   Makefiles support OPeNDAP version 3.5.0+ by default
   doc/opendap.sh demonstrates installing OPeNDAP netCDF client library

6. Compiler support: Intel icc and icpc 8.1 and 9.0 are fully
   supported on x86 and x86_64 architectures

7. Support secure FTP (SFTP) access, e.g.,
   ncks -l ./ sftp://dust.ess.uci.edu:/home/ftp/pub/zender/nco/in.nc
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#sftp for more info

8. FTP file access uses .netrc file, if present, for passwords
   (useful for Earth System Grid access)
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ftp for more info

9. Enhance CF-1.0 Convention support by adding various fields to 
   "do not touch" grid property list including: area, [lat,lon]_bnds,
   msk_* 

10. Add --hdr/--header option to ncks to pad output file header
    This improves I/O on files requiring multiple metadata changes
    See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#hdr for more info

11. ncbo works better with incommensurate files

12. Preliminary IPCC dataset data reduction chapter in manual

One bugfix in 3.0.2: Certain ncatted invocations failed on Fedora due
to a double-free() error caught by Fedora's security-harded glibc. 

Future: The next release (3.1) will concentrate on MPI-enabled NCO.
I keep saying that, so don't hold your breath.

Enjoy,
Charlie
