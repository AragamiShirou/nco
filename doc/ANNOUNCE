The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.6 are ready.

This release supports the stride argument for all dimensions for all
hyperslabbing operators. Formerly, only ncks offered full stride
support for all dimensions, while ncra and ncrcat only supported stride
for the record (time) dimension. Now non-record stride commands work
everywhere, e.g., subset every other longitude and every other
timestep from multiple files into one file:

ncrcat -d time,,,2 -d lon,,,2 in_*.nc out.nc

Build/runtime changes:

1. Support stride in all dimensions for all hyperslabbing operators 

2. Reduce severity of inter-file non-monotonicity from WARNING to INFO
   Intended to lower user's blood pressure 

Enjoy,
