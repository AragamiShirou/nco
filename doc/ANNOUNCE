The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.3 are ready.

This release corrects a corner-case problem with arithmetic
performed by ncra and ncea that causes record and ensemble averages to 
fail (in an obvious way) when the missing_value equals zero.
The record and ensemble averages would also fail (in a non-obvious)
way whenever an intermediate sum equalled the missing value.
The chances of the latter event ever happening are exceedingly
remote. The new code is faster and fixes both problems. 
Full details are at

Thanks to Remik Ziemlinski for noticing this.

Enjoy,
