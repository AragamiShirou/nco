The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.5 are ready.

This release focuses on improving NCO buildability as DODS clients.
We want more users to take advantage of the network-transparent data
access capabilities of DODS by building NCO as DODS clients.

See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#DODS for more info.
Why use your local CPU when you can slow down a remote DODS server
instead? :)  

Enjoy,
