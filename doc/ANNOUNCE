The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.3 are ready. 
Highlights are significant new features in ncwa and ncap2,
improved CF Convention support, and a fix for empty record variables.

ncap2, the successor to ncap, now has 99% of ncap's features,
and many more high level language features, including array syntax,
if/then constructs, and attribute propagation. 
ncap2 is still a bit alpha, but ready to be tested for functionality.
http://nco.sf.net/ncap2.in demonstrates many ncap2 features. 

Reminder: ncap2 depends on ANTLR to build so do, e.g., 
sudo apt-get install antlr libantlr-dev 
before running NCO's configure
