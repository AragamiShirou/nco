The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.1 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.1 contains mainly build and benchmarking improvements.
The only user-visible change is one more tweak to the default ncks
printing behavior. There is an important bug-fix for ncap.
ncap users should upgrade.

1. ncks printing behavior:
   ncks in.nc : Prints all data and metadata
   ncks -M in.nc : Prints only global metadata
   ncks -m in.nc : Prints only variable metadata
   ncks -H in.nc : Prints only variable data
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncks for details.

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam):

3. ncap exponentiation bugfix. Versions < 3.0.1 incorrectly
   handle exponentiation of a variable to a variable power
   (V^V). We recommend that all ncap users upgrade.

Enjoy,
Charlie
