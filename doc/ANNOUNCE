The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.5.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage, Mailing lists)
http://github.com/nco (Source Code, Releases, Developers)

First, NCO now resides at http://github.com/nco, i.e., it is a
GitHub organization. We are pleased to co-habit with the pyNCO
project of Joe Hamman who has produced NCO Python bindings.
Please check 'em out. All GitHub paths with "czender" instead of
"nco" as the username will still work, but should be updated.
Change your local copy of the repository with:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/nco/nco.git

This NCO release improves regridding features, ncra weighting, and
ncatted flexibility, and contains a raft of minor fixes and tunings.
Also, in case you need updated NCO versions at US computing centers,
know that we now maintain up-to-date NCO in ~zender/[bin,lib] at
ANL/ALCF (cooley), NCAR/NWSC (yellowstone), LBNL/NERSC (edison), and 
ORNL/OLCF (rhea).

Work on NCO 4.5.3 has commenced and will better support regional
regridding, masks, threading, CF-checking and easier builds on
computer systems that use modules.  

Enjoy,
Charlie

NEW FEATURES (full details always in ChangeLog):

A. All operators can now add user-specified global attributes to
   output files using the --glb switch. The switch takes mandatory
   arguments --glb att_nm=att_val where att_nm is the desired name of
   the global attriute to add, and att_val is its value.
   Currently only text attributes are supported (recorded as type
   NC_CHAR, and regular expressions are not allowed (unlike ncatted). 
   Multiple invocations simplify the annotation of output file at
   creation (or modification) time, and incur no performance penalty.
   Should users emit a loud hue and cry, we will consider ading the
   the functionality of ncatted to the front-end of all operators,
   i.e., accepting valid arguments to modify attributes of any type
   and to apply regular expressions. 
   ncra --glb machine=${HOSTNAME} --glb created_by=${USER} in*.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#glb

B. Grid generation: ncks generates SCRIP-format gridfiles for
   select grid types, in cluding uniform/equi-angular, cap/FV, and 
   Gaussian. Options pertinent to the grid geometry and metadata are
   passed to NCO via key-value pairs prefixed by "--rgr". Pass at
   least six key-value pair arguments to create a fully explicitly
   specified, well-annotated grid. The six arguments, and their
   corresponding keys in parentheses, are: grid title (grd_ttl),
   filename to write the grid to (grid), number of latitudes
   (lat_nbr), number of longitudes (lon_nbr), latitude grid type
   (lat_typ), and longitude grid type (lon_typ). Four other arguments
   (the NSEW bounding box) are necessary to construct regular regional
   (non-global) grids.
   ncks -grid=FV129x256.nc \
   --rgr lat_nbr=129 --rgr lon_nbr=256 --rgr lat_typ=cap
   --rgr lon_typ=grn_ctr ~zender/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -grid=T42.nc \
   --rgr lat_nbr=64 --rgr lon_nbr=128 --rgr lat_typ=gss
   --rgr lon_typ=grn_ctr ~zender/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grid

C. Regrid regional datasets with ESMF, SCRIP, and TempestRemap
   mapfiles. Please give it a try and send us feedback!
   # Regrid global file to regional domain
   ncks --map map_conusx4v1_to_fv0.1x0.1_US_bilin.nc in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid

D. Multi-file operators support a new extension to the -n option
   that understands calendar month counting. It is now possibly to
   automatically generate series of filenames whose right-most two
   digits increment from a specified minimum (e.g., 03) by a specified
   amount (e.g., 1) until a specified maximum (e.g., 05) is reached
   and then the leftmost digits (i.e., the year) increments by one,
   and the whole process is reapeated until the total specified number
   of filenames is generated.
   ncrcat -n 3,6,1,12,1,yyyymm 198512.nc 198512_198602.nc

BUG FIXES:

A. The ncra --wgt option, introduced in 4.4.9, works fine except,
   it turns out, for variables with missing values. The normalization
   for these values was incorrect and produced errors whose size was
   roughly inversely proportional to the size of the weights.
   The solution is to upgrade to 4.5.2. Thanks to Jeff Painter for
   reporting this problem.

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO NCO:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.5.2-alpha7 built/tested with netCDF
   4.4.0-development (20150818) on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.13 with:

   cd ~/nco;./configure # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem?)
   ncra/ncrcat (not ncks) hyperslabbing can fail on variables with multiple record dimensions

   Demonstration:
   ncrcat -O -d time,0 ~/nco/data/mrd.nc ~/foo.nc

   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140619: Problem reported by rmla
   Cause: Unsure. Maybe ncra.c loop structure not amenable to MRD?
   Workaround: Convert to fixed dimensions then hyperslab

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO BASE LIBRARIES/PROTOCOLS:

A. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 or HDF5 problem?)
   Specifying strided hyperslab on large netCDF4 datasets leads
   to slowdown or failure with recent netCDF versions.

   Demonstration with NCO <= 4.4.5:
   time ncks -O -d time,0,,12 ~/ET_2000-01_2001-12.nc ~/foo.nc
   Demonstration with NCL:
   time ncl < ~/nco/data/ncl.ncl   
   20140718: Problem reported by Parker Norton
   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140930: Finish NCO workaround for problem
   Cause: Slow algorithm in nc_var_gets()?
   Workaround #1: Use NCO 4.4.6 or later (avoids nc_var_gets())
   Workaround #2: Convert file to netCDF3 first, then use stride

B. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails
