The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)

Version 3.0.3 contains many internal changes (build,
benchmarking, memory usage, and documentation improvements),
new I/O features, and convenience routines for IPCC processing.

1. ncwa most rapidly varying dimension (MRV) averaging speed-up:
   Complaints about ncwa being a slow averager (Brian, Byron... :))
   are as old as NCO itself. 
   I've finally implemented an MRV-averaging acceleration algorithm.
   This improves zonal- (longitude) and area- (latitude/longitude)
   averaging throughput by a factor of five--ten on files which
   adhere to CF conventions (t,z,y,x).
   Improvement is seen in all MRV averages with no downside for
   non-MRV averages.
   Should have done this long ago!

2. ncap random number generator:
   

2. Autotools builds (Harry Mangalam): fixes to configure for
   --enable-netcdf4 and  --enable-mpi

3. MPI-enabled operators have zero-known bugs! ZKB! (Daniel Wang)

Enjoy,
Charlie
