The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.3.6 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

The current release brings group support to ncra, ncea, and ncrcat. 
Now ten operators fully support group hierarchies: ncbo, ncea, ncecat, 
ncflint, ncks, ncpdq, ncra, ncrcat, ncrename, and ncwa. The operators
that do no yet fully support group hierarchies are ncatted and ncap2.

Rounding errors can accumulate to worrisome levels during arithmetic
performed on large (>~10,000) arrays of single precision floats. 
Now NCO has the --dbl switch that forces operators to coerce
single-precision numbers to double-precision for arithemetic.
It is expensive in terms of time and RAM, and often not warranted.
Use this switch to guarantee preserving maximum precision.
Or if you want your NCO answers on single-precision fields to always
agree exactly with tools that always promote (NCL, Matlab, IDL). 
The manual now contains a detailed discussion of the issues.

Unfortunately progress sometimes comes at a price in bugs :)
4.3.5 fixes a nasty ncwa bug present in 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.
Nasty means that it could produce wrong answers that look right.
Fortunately, it could only occur when simultaneously averaging and
hyperslabbing, e.g., ncwa -a lat,lon -d lat,0.,90. in.nc out.nc.
Such users should immediately upgrade to 4.3.5 and re-check results.
Full details below.

Work on NCO 4.3.6 is underway and includes improved netCDF4 support
for more NCO operators (ncatted) and improved support for HDF4 files. 

Enjoy,
Charlie

"New stuff" in 4.3.6 summary (full details always in ChangeLog):

NEW FEATURES:

A. New default: Forced conversion of float->double.
   Until 4.3.4 NCO never converted single-precision reals (i.e.,
   floats) to double-precision reals (i.e., doubles) prior to
   arithmetic unless other doubles were involved. In 4.3.5 NCO
   implemented an option, --dbl, to manually force such float->double
   promotion. As of 4.3.6 the promotion employed by --dbl is the
   default and it need not be explicitly requested. The old behavior
   of not promoting floats must now be manually selected with --flt.
   These commands are now identical:
   ncea = ncea --dbl 
   ncra = ncra --dbl
   ncwa = ncwa --dbl
   And the old behvior of these operators is obtained by
   ncea --flt
   ncra --flt
   ncwa --flt
   Other operators are unaffected.
   The new behavior preserves more precision.
   The old behavior is faster and uses less RAM.
   The manual contains a detailed discussion of the issues:

BUG FIXES:

A. Fixed ncea 4.3.5 bug that caused a core dump on some files

A. Fixed ncwa 4.3.5 bug that sometime changed record dimensions
   to fixed dimensions on dimensions that were not averaged.

KNOWN ISSUES NOT YET FIXED:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.3.6 built/tested with netCDF
   4.3.1-rc3 snapshot 20130827 on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.9 with these methods: 

   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make all;make ncap2 # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED
   netCDF4 library fails when renaming dimension and variable using
   that dimension, in either order. Works fine with netCDF3.
   Problem with netCDF4 library implementation.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -4 -v lat_T42 ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncrename -O -D 2 -d lat_T42,lat -v lat_T42,lat ~/foo.nc ~/foo2.nc # Breaks with "NetCDF: HDF error"
   ncks -m ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report filed: netCDF #YQN-334036: problem renaming dimension and coordinate in netCDF4 file

B. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug report filed: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails 

D. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not yet sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

"Sticky" reminders:

A. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

B. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

C. Pre-built Windows (native) and Cygwin binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#windows

D. Pre-built AIX binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#aix

E. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

F. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, chunking, and groups.

G. Reminder that ncks, ncecat, ncbo, ncflint, and ncpdq work on many common
   HDF5 datasets, e.g., 
   NASA AURA HIRDLS HDF-EOS5
   NASA ICESat GLAS HDF5
   NASA SBUV HDF5...
