Finally this release marks the return of pre-built, up-to-date, Debian
binary packages. Grab 'em from http://nco.sf.net#debian

Two extended abstracts describe new results with Distributed Data
Reduction and Analysis using NCO. We will present these at the San 
Antonio AMS in January (with newer results). All NCO pubs are at: 

http://nco.sf.net#pub

Build/runtime changes:

1. Warn when _Fillvalue defined and missing_value not

2. Compile-time option to treat _Fillvalue (instead of missing_value) as missing

3. Debian/Ubuntu packages include ncap2

Enjoy,
Charlie
