The netCDF operators NCO version 3.2.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.2.0 contains new documentation, new ncap2 features,
and better configure support for IRIX.

A. ncks copying of variable and global metadata is configurable (-m, -M).
   Formerly there was no way to append a variable from in.nc to out.nc
   without bringing its metadata and all global metadata with it. 
   ncks -A           in.nc out.nc # Append variable and global attributes
   ncks -O           in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -v one       in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -O -v one    in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable and global attributes
   ncks -A -v one    in.nc out.nc # Append variable not global attributes
   ncks -A -M -v one in.nc out.nc # Append variable not global attributes
   ncks -O -M -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   variable not global attributes
   ncks -O -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   global not variable attributes
   ncks -O -M -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy   data only, no attributes
   ncks -A    -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Append data only, no attributes

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standar grids, e.g., 2D grids 
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grd

D. ncks reports input file type (e.g., NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC,
   NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4) as part of global metadata

E. ncks prints all netCDF4 atomic data types (NC_UBYTE, NC_INT64, etc.) 

E. Fix ncap2 .total() method to correctly handle missing_values fxm

E. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.

   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

F. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   "apt-get install nco" also retrieves these versions
