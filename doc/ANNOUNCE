The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.8 are ready.

A. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
On Fri, 11 Nov 2005, Waylon Collins posed netcdfgroup this problem:
"Any datum of variable X, within netCDF file with filename F.nc,
that equals 32, change it to the value 45. Thus, the original file
F.nc is now altered, or the altered file is now named G.nc"
The ncap2 solution is:

ncap2 -s 'mask=(X==32);X=mask*45+!mask*X' F.nc G.nc

B. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available
and they include ncap2. Get them directly with "apt-get install nco".
Other users, e.g., Ubuntu, get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian

C. Two extended abstracts describe new results with Distributed Data
Reduction and Analysis using NCO. We will present these at the San 
Antonio AMS in January (with newer results). All NCO pubs are at: 

http://nco.sf.net#pub

Build/runtime changes:

1. Warn when ((_FillValue is) and (missing_value is not)) defined

2. Compile-time option to treat _FillValue (instead of missing_value) as missing

3. Debian/Ubuntu packages include ncap2

Enjoy,
Charlie
