The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release fixes a recently discovered ncwa bug.
This bug caused ncwa to produce garbage when processing packed NC_FLOAT data. 
Upgrade to 2.9.1 if you process packed data with ncwa.

This problem may have been noticed most by DODS users since many
netCDF climate dataset served by DODS are packed NC_FLOAT data. 
Thanks to me (pat self on back) for the bug report and to Rorik
Peterson for fixing it. 

NB: Solaris cc/CC autotools builds have been broken on Solaris 2.7
and earlier Solaris version since NCO version 2.8.6. 
Solaris users are urged to upgrade their OS.

The NSF proposal I am writing to fund improving distributed data
processing with NCO is at 

http://dust.ess.uci.edu/prp/prp_sei/prp_sei.pdf

Plans for future proposals are mentioned in the NUG at
