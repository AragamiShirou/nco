The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.8 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

The significant new changes are that ncbo supports threading.
Manually configure threading with -t (as with ncra, ncpdq, ncea), or
ncbo will pick a default for you.

fxm First, AIX NCO installations should upgrade to this version to get the 
AIX-specific ncap bug-fix. 

Enjoy,
Charlie
