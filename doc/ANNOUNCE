The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.5 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release focuses on improving NCO buildability/configuration.
Most notably we now updated and simplified support the latest DODS.
See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#DODS for more info.
We want more users to take advantage of the network-transparent data
access capabilities of DODS by building NCO as DODS clients.

Why use your local CPU when you can slow down a remote DODS server
instead? :)  

Thanks to Rorik and Henry for their continuing contributions.

Enjoy,
Charlie
