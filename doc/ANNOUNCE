The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.4 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release includes numerous minor fixes and improvements to netCDF4
capability, adds more polish to ncap2, and improves the ncks
multi-slabbing algorithm (MSA).

A. Operators given -3 switch will (attempt to) produce netCDF3 output,
   even if input files are netCDF4. Converse of -4 switch behavior.
   Same as --fl_fmt=classic

B. ncks supports hyperslab specification with CF auxiliary coordinates
   for standard_name=latitude, longitude. (Karen Schuchardt)
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#aux

C. New ncks Multi-slabbing algorithm (MSA) switch:
   When --msa_usr_rdr (MSA user order) is specified, hyperslabbed
   coordinate(s) will appear in the output file in the order of the 
   input multi-slabs. The output coordinate will only be monotonic
   if the user specifies the multi-slabs in a monotonic order.
   This option significantly improves performance on complex
   multi-slab operations. (Henry Butowsky)

D. Cleanup cygwin builds for WIN32

E. OpenMP builds of ncap2 with pgCC

F. AIX configure finds atan2() for ncap2

G. mpncrcat works with netCDF4 (Takeshi Enomoto)

H. File "consanguinity": output file format defaults to input format

I. ncks prints netCDF4 LZ compression information to stdout
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncks

J. ncap2 uses OpenMP more, writes nco_openmp_thread_number (Henry Butowsky)
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#openmp

K. ncap2 prints attributes, supports atan2() and pow() (Henry Butowsky)
   Demonstration scripts ~/nco/data/ncap2_tst.nco

L. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

M. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

N. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote servers: 

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work with with any command-line operator analysis scripts-- 
   not just NCO. If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your
   client before you analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up.
   Try SWAMP give us your feedback.

O. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.4 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8 beta2 
   and netCDF4 snapshot20070822 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
