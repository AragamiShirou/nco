The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.1 are ready.

There one notable changes since version 2.8.0:

1. Henry Butowsky implemented the capability of specifying variable
   names to all operators using regular expressions. For example,
   ncks -v 'DSTQ??' selects all six-letter variables whose first four
   letters are DSTQ. We call this capability wildcarding, and it is
   very useful for sub-setting large data files such as those produced
   by chemical transport models.

Enjoy,
Charlie
