The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco/nco.tar.gz (new location)

There is one notable change since version 2.7.4:

1. The new netCDF Binary Operator (ncbo) does file addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. ncbo obsoletes ncdiff.
ncdiff is now installed by default as a symobolic link to the ncbo 
executable (in the same way that ncea and ncrcat are links to ncra). 
User's who continue to use ncdiff should notice no difference.
'ncdiff' is identical to 'ncbo --op_typ=sub'.
Please read the User's guide for a full explanation and a description
of the shortcuts available to mimic the old behavior (e.g., using
'ncadd' instead of 'ncbo --op_typ=add').

2. Rumors that ncap would eat ncwa proved premature.

3. 

Enjoy,
Charlie
