The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.4 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release fixes index-based hyperslabbing which broke in 2.7.3.
This nasty bug caused index-based hyperslabs, e.g., -d lat,1, to
behave like value-based hyperslabs, e.g., -d lat,1.0 under some
conditions. 
Unfortunately, the incorrect answers generated may be hard to notice!
_Versions 2.7.3--2.8.3 are buggy and should be upgraded ASAP_.
Re-do any data-processing that used index-based hyperslabbing with
these versions of NCO.

Thanks to Mike Page for reporting the bug and to Rorik for fixing it.

User's of ncap and AMD Opteron owners will notice other improvements.

Enjoy,
Charlie
