The netCDF operators NCO version 2.7.4 are ready.

There are two changes since version 2.7.3:

1. Improvements to AIX support, especially autotools support.
Contributed by Jim Edwards of NCAR. Thanks, Jim!
2. Fix limit parsing so hyperslabs specified in floating point format
do not confuse UDUnits interface layer. This resulted in core dumps
(but not wrong answers) in 2.7.3. Fixed by Rorik Peterson.

Enjoy,
Charlie
