The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.7 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version primarily improves documentation and buildability
of the GSL-library functions introduced in 3.9.6.

http://nco.sf.net#gsl

A. Document GSL functions in ncap2
   http://nco.sf.net#ncap2

B. Improve ./configure ability to find and work with GSL
   
C. New ncks --no_dmn_var_nm switch implements "naked" column printing
   http://nco.sf.net#ncks

D. ncatted matches regular expressions to variable names
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#xmp_ncatted

I. CF-convention "coordinates" attribute strings with excessive
   whitespace work with ncks -c

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Intrepid packages available:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built (possibly out-of-date) Fedora and CentOS RPMs available:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Find/add NCO tips and tricks on the NCO Wiki (thanks to Tom Roche):

   http://nco.wiki.sourceforge.net

N. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote servers: 

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up. 
   Try SWAMP give us your feedback.

O. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.7 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8.1
   and netCDF4 final and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
Charlie
