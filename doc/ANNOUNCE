The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.1 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.1 contains mainly build and benchmarking improvements.
The only user-visible change is one more tweak to the default ncks
printing behavior. There is an important bug-fix for ncap.
ncap users should upgrade.

1. ncks printing behavior:
   ncks in.nc : Prints all data and metadata
   ncks -M in.nc : Prints only global metadata
   ncks -m in.nc : Prints only variable metadata
   ncks -H in.nc : Prints only variable data
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncks for details.

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam):

3. ncap exponentiation bugfix. Versions < 3.0.1 incorrectly
   handle exponentiation of a variable to a variable power
   (V^V). We recommend that all ncap users upgrade.

4. All operators except ncap are now memory pure.
   No uninitialized memory is referenced, and
   no unfree'd or "still reachable" memory exists at operator exit.
   valgrind is used to verify this.
   Actually, system libraries and libnetcdf.a have minor
   memory transgressions.
   The point is that NCO causes no memory leaks.

Enjoy,
Charlie
