The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.5 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release implements a new way to specify output files to NCO.
Output files may now be specified with -o (or --fl_out or --output),
or as last positional argument (the traditional behavior). 
This facilitate processing of large numbers of files by multi-file
operators (ncra, ncrcat, ncecat) by using the xargs command, e.g.,

/bin/ls | grep day_after_tomorrow_????.nc | xargs ncra -o dat.nc

Using xargs or perl to handle these situations is now documented in

http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#lrg

The new -o fl_out behavior works on all operators.
ncwa was the only operator that previously used -o for anything.
It use the -o switch for passing relational operator types for masking.
The new ncwa single-letter option for this is -t for "truth condition".
The preferred ncwa switches are now --truth_condition or --msk_cmp_typ
for "mask comparison type". 
The old ncwa long options synonyms --cmp, --compare, and --op_cmp were
removed to reduce the burgeoning number of synonyms.
The other ncwa -o long-option synonym, --op_rlt, works as usual.
Please modify ncwa scripts accordingly.
Unmodified ncwa scripts which expect the old behavior of -o will fail
with a harmless error stating that too many input filenames are present.

Enjoy,
Charlie
