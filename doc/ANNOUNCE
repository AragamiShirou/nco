The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

There are two notable changes since version 2.7.4:

1. The new netCDF Binary Operator (ncbo) does file addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. ncbo obsoletes ncdiff.
ncdiff is now installed by default as a symobolic link to the ncbo 
executable (in the same way that ncea and ncrcat are links to ncra). 
User's who continue to use ncdiff should notice no difference.
'ncdiff' is identical to 'ncbo --op_typ=sub'.
Please read the User's guide for a full explanation and a description
of the shortcuts available to mimic the old behavior (e.g., using
'ncadd' instead of 'ncbo --op_typ=add').

2. Debian integration: Thanks to Rorik Peterson, NCO is now fully
Debianized. This means that Debian packages may be built from the
plain NCO source tree. The homepage contains links to these .deb
packages for 2.8.0. In the near future, we will upload each new tagged 
version directly into the Debian Sid (unstable) distribution at
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian. At that time, Sid user's will have
a current NCO after each "apt-get dist-upgrade". These packages
will eventually migrate into Sarge and Woody in a more timely manner.

Enjoy,
Charlie
