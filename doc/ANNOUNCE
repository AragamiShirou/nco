The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.1 are ready. 
This is mainly a development release for internal consumption.
There are a few bugfixes in dark corners of the code.

All previous NCO versions incorrectly stored non-processed packed data 
incorrectly in the output file. This meant, for example, that a packed
non-record variable would be stored incorrectly after the whole file
was passed through ncra. Non-processed packed data is now stored
correctly. Thanks to Martin Dix for reporting this problem.
