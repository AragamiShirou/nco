The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.2 contains mainly internal changes such as build,
benchmarking, memory usage, and documentation improvements.

1. OpenMP: Only one critical region remains in netCDF reads

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam): 

3. ncap (Henry Butowsky): Improved memory efficiency

4. MPI (Gayathri Venkitachalam): Beta-version MPI-enabled operators
   mpncflint, mpncecat, mpncwa, mpncpdq, mpncra, mpncrcat, mpncea
   Build them with 'cd ~/nco/bld;make MPI=Y' and run them with mpirun! 

5. OPeNDAP (Harry Mangalam and James Gallagher): 
   Makefiles support OPeNDAP version 3.5.0+ by default
   doc/opendap.sh demonstrates installing OPeNDAP netCDF client library

6. Compiler support: Intel icc and icpc 8.1 and 9.0 are fully
   supported on x86 and x86_64 architectures

7. Support secure FTP (SFTP) access, e.g.,
   ncks -l ./ sftp://dust.ess.uci.edu:/home/ftp/pub/zender/nco/in.nc
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#sftp for more info

8. FTP file access uses .netrc file, if present, for passwords
   (useful for Earth System Grid access)
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ftp for more info

Future: The next release (3.1) will concentrate on MPI-enabled NCO.

Enjoy,
Charlie
