The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.4 are ready. 
This is a bug-fix release only.

ncbo in version 3.1.3 suffers from a trivial memory error which 
causes it to segfault after writing a correct output file.

There is also one user-visible change in that running any operator
with a debug level greater than zero now reports timer results.

Enjoy,
Charlie
