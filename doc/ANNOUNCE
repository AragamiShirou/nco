   Build them with 'cd ~/nco/bld;make MPI=Y' and run them with mpirun!

   Makefiles support OPeNDAP version 3.5.0+ by default
   doc/opendap.sh demonstrates installing OPeNDAP netCDF client library

6. Compiler support: Intel icc and icpc 8.1 and 9.0 are fully
   supported on x86 and x86_64 architectures

Future: The next release (3.1) will concentrate on MPI-enabled NCO.
