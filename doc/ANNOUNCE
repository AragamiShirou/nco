The netCDF operators NCO version 2.1.0 are ready. 
Changes since version 2.0.0 include bugfixes and a 
rough but working (and powerful!) ncap implementation.
ncap is the netCDF arithmetic processor, an operator
which uses a built-in parser to perform arbitrary
arithmetic commands on a netCDF file.
ncap is completely undocumented but see
nco/data/ncap.in for a sample run script. 
NCO version >= 2.0.1 requires netCDF version >= 3.5.
Get the new version of NCO and read the user's guide on

http://nco.sourceforge.net

Summary of changes:

1. Fix ncks units printing bug introduced in 2.0 (Zender)
2. Improved version information with, e.g., ncks -r (Zender)
3. Use new NC_NAT token requires netCDF 3.5 (Zender)
4. ncap: Major progress towards completion including I/O ability, 
attribute handling, fuller lexer/parser, error diagnostics (Butowsky)

Enjoy,
Charlie
