The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.1 are ready.

There is one notable feature improvement since version 2.8.0:

1. Henry Butowsky implemented the capability of specifying variable
   names to all operators using extended regular expression pattern
   matching (i.e., expressions supported by 'egrep'). For example, 

   ncks -v '^DSTQ[0-9]{2}' in.nc out.nc

   selects all six-letter variables whose first four characters are
   DSTQ and last two characters are digits.
   We call this capability "variable wildcarding". It is very useful
   for sub-setting large data files such as those produced by chemical 
   transport models.  

There are also minor build-related improvements for autotools and Debian.
In particular, autotools support for non-LINUX platforms is improved.
getopt_long() problems seen with SGI builds of 2.8.0 appear to be fixed.

Enjoy,
Charlie
