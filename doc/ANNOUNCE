The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.7 are ready.

This release marks the deprecation of ncap for ncap2.
ncap2 is backward-compatible with ncap, and provides much
more powerful functionality now and its features are improving.
We will continue to ship ncap though we encourage migration to ncap2 
starting now.

Note that building ncap2 requires the ANTLR library and headers which 
in turn require Java. It is trivial to install ANTLR with Linux (i.e.,
apt-get install antlr libantlr-dev) but non-trivial on big-iron UNIX
if sysadmins are not used to supporting Java or ANTLR. So if you want
ncap2 on non-Linux machines, be nice to your sysadmins.

Build/runtime changes:

1. Update netCDF4 support to alpha17

2. Die gracefully rather than segfault on mal-formed hyperslab strings

3. Document hdr_pad options

4. ncap2 supports "double-parsing"

Enjoy,
Charlie
