The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

First, the NCO licenses have changed from GPL2 (code) and FDL1.1
(documentation) to GPL3 (code) and FDL1.2 (documentation).

Second, 3.9.2 also introduces ncap2 printing and type-conversion 
and beta-support for UDUnits2. As usual the latest build
and compile tweaks have been made to improve portability.

Finally, the major user-visible change is that the default attribute  
if any, specifying the value of data to ignore has (finally) changed 
from "missing_value" to "_FillValue".
Supporting both of these attributes simultaneously is not practical.
Hence the behavior NCO used to apply to missing_value's now applies to
_FillValue's---missing_value's are now treated as normal data. 

It has been and remains most advisable to create both _FillValue
and missing_value attributes with identical values in datasets.
Nevertheless, many legacy datasets contain on "missing_value".
Here are two commands that will help migrating datasets.

# Rename all missing_value attributes to _FillValue
ncrename -a .missing_value,_FillValue inout.nc

# Add _FillValue attribute to all variables
ncatted -O -a _FillValue,,o,f,1.0e36 inout.nc

The old functionality, i.e., where the ignored values are indicated by
"missing_value" not "_FillValue", may be selected _at build time_ by 
compiling NCO with the token definition 

CPPFLAGS='-DNCO_MSS_VAL_SNG=missing_value'

A. Change from GPL2 to GPL3

B. UDUnits2 beta-support. Compile with 'UDUNITS2=Y' and send us 
   feedback. Binary distributions (RPMs, Debs) still use UDUnits1.

C. Use _FillValue rather than missing_value attribute
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#_FillValue

D. Improved Documentation:
   Working with non-standard grids, e.g., 2D grids fxm
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grd

E. ncap2 continues to grow more powerful (Henry Butowsky)
   Demonstration scripts ~/nco/data/[bin_cnt.nco,psd_wrf.nco]   

F. ncap2 supports type conversion (Henry Butowsky)
   ncap2 -s 'big_int=uint64(small_int)+double(small_int);' in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2 

G. ncap2 now prints variables and metadata (Henry Butowsky)
   ncap2 -s 'foo=1;print(foo)' in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2 

H. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid & Ubuntu binaries are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

I. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available.
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

J. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.2 with netCDF4 support has been built and tested 
   with HDF5 1.8 beta2 and netCDF4 snapshot20070727 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Our next release will debut a user-friendly version of SWAMP, our
server-side processing system (http://dust.ess.uci.edu/ppr/ppr_WZJ073.pdf).   

Enjoy,
Charlie
