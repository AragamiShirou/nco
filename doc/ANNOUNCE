The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.1 are ready.

There is one notable feature improvement since version 2.8.0:

1. Henry Butowsky implemented the capability of specifying variable
   names to all operators using regular expressions. For example,
   ncks -v 'DSTQ??' selects all six-letter variables whose first four
   letters are DSTQ. We call this capability wildcarding, and it is
   very useful for sub-setting large data files such as those produced
   by chemical transport models.

There are also minor build-related improvements for autotools and Debian.
In particular, autotools support for non-LINUX platforms is improved.
getopt_long() problems seen with SGI builds of 2.8.0 appear to be fixed.

Enjoy,
Charlie
