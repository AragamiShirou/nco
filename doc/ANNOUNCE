The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.7 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release fixes one important and known bug,
http://nco.sf.net#bug_hyp_dgn.

Also worth mentioning again is that the latest Debian (Sid) and Ubuntu
(Maverick) NCO packages support DAP, netCDF4, and UDUnits2.  

http://nco.sf.net#debian
http://nco.sf.net#ubuntu

Work on NCO 4.0.7 is underway, focused on issued described in the new  
KNOWN BUGS NOT YET FIXED section below.

Enjoy,
Charlie

"New stuff" in 4.0.7 summary (full details always in ChangeLog):

A. Hi

A. MPI executables mpncpdq, mpncra, mpncwa have been updated to
   the same feature set as the normal, non-MPI executables.
   Now all MPI executables are feature-equivalent to serial codes. fxm

KNOWN BUGS NOT YET FIXED:

   This is a new section of the ANNOUNCE file intended to make clear
   the existence and severity of known, but not fixed, problems

A. NOT YET FIXED
   Return correct hyperslabs returned for bounding boxes specified with
   -d or -X that do not include at least one point. Instead of
   returning no data, sometimes hyperslabs would return all data. 
   Thanks to Jeff Daily for reporting this. 
   This problem is serious and users should upgrade once fix arrives:
   http://nco.sf.net#bug_hyp_dgn

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -v lat -d lat,20.,20.001 ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc # broken---returns all values but should return none

   20110114: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report: TODO nco1007.

B. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly handle stride argument when accessing some files through some DAP servers.  
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -F -D 9 -v weasdsfc -d time,100,110,5 http://nomad3.ncep.noaa.gov:9090/dods/reanalyses/reanalysis-2/6hr/flx/flx ~/foo.nc # Fails as of 20110114, old DAP server?
   ncks -O -F -D 9 -v three_dmn_rec_var -d time,1,10,5 http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods/in.nc ~/foo.nc # Works as of 20110114

   20110114: Verified problem still exists on NOAA DAP server
   Bug report not filed: Suggest users upgrade DAP servers?

C. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly handle NC_CHAR coordinates (like fl_dmn) on DAP files.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -D 4 -v fl_dmn -O http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods/in.nc ~/foo.nc

   20110114: Fixed in Unidata DAP server? Need confirmation works elsewhere
   Bug report filed: netCDF #JZN-949284 NC_CHAR coordinate via DAP

D. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly average NC_CHAR coordinates from DAP files.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncra -O -C -D 3 -p
   http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc in.nc ~/foo.nc # Breaks with "NetCDF: DAP server error"

   20110114: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report filed: netCDF #JZN-949284 NC_CHAR coordinate via DAP

E. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly read netCDF4 input over DAP, write netCDF4 output, then read resulting file.
   Replacing netCDF4 with netCDF3 in either location of preceding sentence leads to success.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -4 -O -v three_dmn_rec_var http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks ~/foo.nc # breaks with "NetCDF: Invalid dimension ID or name"

   20110114: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report filed: netCDF #QUN-641037: dimension ID ordering assumptions

"Sticky" reminders:

A. All operators support netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   ncks -O -4 --cnk_plc=all in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#chunking

B. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Lucid packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

C. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

D. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

E. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.7 with was built and tested with HDF5 hdf5-1.8.4-patch1 and with
   4.1.2-beta2-snapshot2010101108
   NCO may not build with earlier, and should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.7 takes advantage of an
   internal change to the netCDF nc_def_var_chunking() API in June 2009. 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make all;make ncap2 # Old Makefile mechanism

F. Have you seen the NCO logo candidates by Tony Freeman, Rich
   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?
