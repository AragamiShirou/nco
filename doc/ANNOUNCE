The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)

Version 3.1.0 achieves two major milestones:
1. All arithmetic operators work and are bug-free in MPI mode. 
2. netcdf4-alpha support works well and is numerically correct.

Using MPI, NCO can now distribute computations among multiple nodes
which share disk space. This is the first step toward truly efficient
distributed versions of NCO toward which we are working. 
These more efficient versions will utilize parallel I/O techniques
from netcdf4 and/or pnetcdf. 

We may refer to NCO version 3.1.0+ as SDO, Scientific Data Operators. 
For now it is just the same old netCDF data, but with the HDF files
it now supports via netCDF4, and other upcoming features, the name
does need to change.

1. MPI-enabled operators have zero-known bugs! ZKB! (Daniel Wang)

2. Autotools builds (Harry Mangalam): fixes to configure for
   --enable-netcdf4 and --enable-mpi
   Benchmarks also work in these modes--try 'em out.

3. Supports netcdf4-alpha10. Currently reads/writes HDF, no other 
   netCDF4 features supported yet. 

4. ncwa most rapidly varying dimension (MRV) averaging speed-up:
   Complaints about ncwa being a slow averager (Brian, Byron... :))
   are as old as NCO itself. 
   I've finally implemented an MRV-averaging acceleration algorithm.
   This improves zonal- (longitude) and area- (latitude/longitude)
   averaging throughput by a factor of five--ten on files which
   adhere to CF conventions (t,z,y,x).
   Improvement is seen in all MRV averages with no downside for
   non-MRV averages. Should have done this long ago!
   Recommend upgrade if you use ncwa a lot.

5. ncap has a random number generator: rnd_nbr()

Enjoy,
