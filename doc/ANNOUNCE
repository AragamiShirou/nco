The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.3 contains many internal changes (build,
benchmarking, memory usage, and documentation improvements),
new I/O features, and convenience routines for IPCC processing.

1. OpenMP: No more critical regions in netCDF reads
   This improves performance on SMP nodes and over OPeNDAP

2. netCDF4: New options -4,--fl_fmt,--netcdf4 for file format
   As a result, the -Z switch has been replaced by --64.
   netCDF4 features require the alpha netCDF4 library.
   Although they work perfectly, use them only for testing
   since the netCDF4 binary format will change in the future.
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#netcdf4 for more info

3. netCDF4 builds (Harry Mangalam): Support configure --enable-netcdf4

4. MPI-enabled operators are 2KB (two-known bugs)
   mpncra/mpncea/mpncrcat can still hang

5. MPI builds (Harry Mangalam): Support configure --enable-mpi

6. Compiler support: Intel icc and icpc 8.1 and 9.0 are fully
   supported on x86 and x86_64 architectures

7. ncks: Eliminated --fmt,--format synonyms to avoid netCDF4 confusion
         Change --sng synonym to --sng_fmt

Enjoy,
Charlie
