The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.8 are ready.

A. ncwa bugfix: 
   ncwa reported NaN/inf for minimization/maximization/summation of
   coordinate variables. This has been fixed. Thanks to Michael Schulz  
   for reporting this bug.

A. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.

A. ncecat and ncea allow files to differ in record dimension size,
   so long as the requested (with -d start.,end.) hyperslab is the
   same size in all dimensions.
   This allows easier gluing/averaging of unequal length timeseries
   from an ensemble of simulations (e.g., the IPCC AR4 archive).

A. The "configure" install method now works for ncap2 on AIX
   Thanks to Martin Schutz for 

B. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available
and they include ncap2. Get them directly with "apt-get install nco".
Other users, e.g., Ubuntu, get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
We plan to add ncap2 to RPM packages in 3.1.9.

C. Three extended abstracts describe new results with Distributed Data 
Reduction and Analysis using NCO. We will present these at the 
San Francisco AGU conference in December, and at the San Antonio AMS
IIPC conference in January (with newer results---come say "Hi!").
All NCO publications, extended abstracts, and posters are at:

Build/runtime changes:

1. Update to DAP for netCDF 3.6.2

2. Debian/Ubuntu packages include ncap2

Enjoy,
