The netCDF operators NCO version 2.8.6 are ready.

This is a paper bag release to correct some platform-specific build
problems introduced in 2.8.5. Custom GCC builds are now warning free
will no longer build when any compiler warnings are encountered.
This will help ensure that fewer bugs burrow into future code.
Builds work again on AIX and SGI (broken in 2.8.5).

Enjoy,
Charlie
