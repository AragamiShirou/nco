The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.5 are ready.

This release fixes a problem with ncflint interpolations
when one of the two inputs was missing_value.
The previous algorithm was non-commutative, i.e., the result
depended on the order the files were specified.
It was also non-intuitive in that it returned the weighted valid datum 
rather than the unweighted valid datum or just missing_value.
The new alorithm is commutative, and much more conservative.
Now, when either of the input datums is missing_value, the result 
is missing_value as well.

I am willing to implement other ncflint algorithms if there is
interest. If you have an opinion about this, please read the new
documentation at

and post your preferences to the NCO discussion forum at

Enjoy,
