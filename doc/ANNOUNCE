The netCDF operators NCO version 2.7.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sourceforge.net
ftp://dust.ess.uci.edu/pub/zender/nco/nco.tar.gz

The only change since version 2.7.2 is the addition of a
shiny new feature, UDUnits compatibility.
As documented in the User's Guide, NCO operators which
accept the -d hyperslabbing arguments now understand
how to translate values in user-specified units to values
in the disk-based units of coordinate variables.
Translation---stuff like this does the right thing:

% ncks -O -C -H -u -v wvl -d wvl,"0.4 micron","0.7 micron" in.nc
wvl[0]=5e-07 meter

ncra -O -d time,"1939-09-09 12:00:0.0","1945-05-08 00:00:0.0" \
in1.nc in2.nc in3.nc out.nc

Rorik Peterson developed and contributed this code to NCO. 
Thanks Rorik!

Enjoy,
Charlie

P.S. This feature changes building NCO slightly: 
If you use the bld/Makefile method, you must build with
make UDUNITS=N if you do not have UDUnits installed.
If you build with ./configure, the build will automagically
build with the UDUnits capability if it finds your
complete UDUnits installation.
