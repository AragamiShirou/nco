The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.8 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)

Release 3.1.9 contains a small ncwa bugfix, new ncea/ncecat features,
new ncap2 features, and configure support for AIX with ncap2.

A. ncwa bugfix: 
   ncwa reported NaN/inf for minimization/maximization/summation of
   coordinate variables. This has been fixed. Thanks to Michael Schulz  
   for reporting this bug.

B. ncecat and ncea now allow files to differ in record dimension size 
   iff the requested (with -d start.,end.) record hyperslab resolves
   to the same size for all files.
   This allows easier gluing/averaging of unequal length timeseries
   from an ensemble of simulations (e.g., the IPCC AR4 archive).

C. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
   Henry keeps adding features. See ~/nco/data/ncap2.in.
   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

D. The "configure" install method now works for ncap2 on AIX
   Thanks to Martin Schutz for encouraging us to finish this.

E. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   Soon "apt-get install nco" will retrieve these versions.
   We gave up putting ncap2 in RPM packages in 3.1.9 because we don't
   have an up-to-date Fedora system to build on.

F. We've recently presented two posters (AGU) and three talks (AMS and
   Opendap conf.) on NCO and the Server side system now called SWAMP.
   NCO publications, extended abstracts, and posters are at:  

   http://nco.sf.net#pub

Build/runtime changes:

1. Update to DAP for netCDF 3.6.2

2. Allow specification of ANTLR_INC to configure, improve AIX linkage

Enjoy,
Charlie
