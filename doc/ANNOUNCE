The netCDF operators NCO version 3.2.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Release 3.2.0 contains new documentation, new ncap2 features,
and better configure support for IRIX.

A. ncks copying of variable and global metadata is configurable (-m, -M).
   Formerly there was no way to append a variable from in.nc to out.nc
   without bringing its metadata and all global metadata with it. 
   ncks -A           in.nc out.nc # Copy variable and global metadata
   ncks -O           in.nc out.nc # Copy variable and global metadata
   ncks -v one       in.nc out.nc # Copy variable and global metadata
   ncks -O -v one    in.nc out.nc # Copy variable and global metadata
   ncks -A -v one    in.nc out.nc # Copy variable not global metadata
   ncks -O -M -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy variable not global metadata
   ncks -O -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy global not variable metadata
   ncks -O -M -m -v one in.nc out.nc # Copy data only, no metadata

C. New Documentation:
   Working with non-standar grids, e.g., 2D grids 
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grd

D. ncks reports input file type (e.g., NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC,
   NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4) as part of global metadata

E. ncap2 (http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2) grows more powerful.
   Henry has ...
   Once threading and for loops are done we'll document it all. 

F. Pre-built, up-to-date, Debian Sid binary packages are available.
   Debian/Ubuntu users may get them from http://nco.sf.net#debian
   "apt-get install nco" also retrieves these versions

G. Pre-built, up-to-date, RPM packages are available, e.g.,
   http://nco.sf.net/src/nco-3.2.0-1.i386.rpm

Enjoy,
