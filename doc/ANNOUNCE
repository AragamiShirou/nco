The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.5 are ready.

http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release has new features only for ncap2. Henry Butowsky has added
vastly more powerful array support, definition and referencing of new
dimensions, and improved error messages, e.g.,

ncap2 -s 'defdim("x",64);x[x]=1.0;x(::2)=0' in.nc out.nc

Many more examples are in http://nco.sf.net/ncap2.in

Those interested in NCO internals might want to read two submitted
manuscripts which describe NCO and its scaling. These are at
