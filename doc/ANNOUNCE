The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.9 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version offers three new significant features:
GSL statistics routines, netCDF4 chunksize support (can 
increase speed of large file reads and writes), and netCDF4 
string support. 

Work on NCO 4.0.0 is underway. Areas of improvement include
more flexible netCDF4 chunking support, better UDUnits2 time support,   
and GSL interpolation and fitting functions.

"New stuff" details:

A. NCO (when enabled with netCDF4) supports new chunk_size option:
   ncks --cnk_sz 1024,1024,1024 in.nc out.nc
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#chunking

B. ncap2 supports the GSL (Chapter 20) statistics routines, e.g.,
   ncap2 -v -O -s 'defdim("dmn",100);sigma[dmn]=1.0;var1=gsl_ran_gaussian(sigma);var2=gsl_stats_skew(var1);print(var2)' in.nc out.nc
   A list of ncap2 functions added since 3.9.8 is below

C. NCO (when enabled with netCDF4) supports NC_STRING atomic type.
   NCO has long-supported the other netCDF4 atomic types. 
   NCO now manipulates (ragged arrays of) strings, e.g., 
   ncap2 -4 -O -v -s 'name[lat]={"US"s,"Them"s};' in.nc out.nc
   netCDF4 strings are placed in double quotes with a trailing "s".

D. ncks --secret prints hidden/unsupported options

"Sticky" reminders:

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Intrepid packages:

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

M. Find/add NCO tips and tricks on the NCO Wiki:

N. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

O. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 3.9.9 with was built and tested with HDF5 1.8.2-post6 and with
   netCDF4 4.1-beta1-snapshot2009050200.   

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

P. Did you see the NCO logo candidate submitted by Tony Freeman?
   What do you think? Should it replace the mandleblob?
