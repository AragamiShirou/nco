The netCDF operators NCO version 4.2.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release finishes some older work and marks the beginning of
new functionality supported by our NASA ACCESS grant. Old stuff first:
Optional specification of header pads in all operators and of negative
hyperslab indices (to count backwards from the end) are now supported
on all operators for which they make sense. And ncwa is now present 
in the windows tarball.

The more exciting work, forthcoming to all of NCO in roughly the
coming year, is better support for netCDF4/HDF5 features. To begin,
ncks now supports group hierarchies and multiple record dimensions.
The most important (in my opinion) netCDF4 feature that ncks does
not support now is user-defined and compound types. These are
currently rarely used so we think ncks will work as is on most netCDF4  
files users are likely to see in the near future. Let us know how you
like, or dislike, the way we have implemented the equivalent
functionality that ncks already had for netCDF3. Your feedback will
help us finalize things like the printed output format for group
information, and tidy up loose ends. 

Work on NCO 4.2.3 is underway: better netCDF4 support for ncks, and
possibly ncdiff. 

Enjoy,
Charlie

Other "New stuff" in 4.2.2 summary (full details always in ChangeLog):

NEW FEATURES:

A. ncks supports netCDF4 groups and multiple record dimensions.
   The key new switches are -g and -G, which do what you would expect:
   extract (or exclude) members of the specified groups. Regular
   expressions work on group names, on variable names, and interact to 
   give users precise and powerful control over subsetting and
   hyperslabbing netCDF4 files. See the new examples at
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#xmp_ncks

A. ncks now prints missing values as underscores ("_") by default.
   Previously ncks printed the numeric representation, e.g., "1.0e36".
   The new behavior mimics ncdump and looks cleaner.
   To revert to the old behavior, use the new --no_blank switch.
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#xmp_ncks

A. ncap2 now understands that negative integers as min or max elements
   of hyperslab specifications indicate offsets from the end.
   The other NCO operators initiated this support as of NCO 4.2.1.
   NCO support for this convention is now complete.
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#hyp

A. Our distribution of native-Windows binaries now includes ncwa,
   making it a complete NCO distribution built with Windows Visual Studio.
   Due to limitations of the Windows programming environment however,
   these executables lack some powerful features present in UNIX:
   Regular expressions, globbing, and network capabilities
   Download your self-extracting executables today
   http://nco.sf.net#windows

A. The --hdr_pad option is now supported by all operators.
   This option is useful in preventing re-copying of netCDF3 files
   whose metadata may be changed after the file is first written.
   Formerly it was present only in ncatted, ncks, and ncrename.
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#hdr

A. ncap2's bilinear_interp() and bilinear_interp_wrap() now have 
   semi-intelligent handling of missing values. Thanks to Henry.

BUG FIXES:

A. Attempts to reach non-existing files behind DAP servers can no
   longer lead to multiple attempts to find the files with wget.
   At most one wget will be attempted.

A. ncatted stopped adding trailing NULs to string (NC_CHAR) attributes
   in NCO version 4.0.2. This was inadvertent. ncatted once again
   ensures string (NC_CHAR) attributes are NUL-terminated, as per the
   netCDF Best Practices recommendation.

KNOWN BUGS NOT YET FIXED:

   This section of the ANNOUNCE file reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.2.2 built/tested with netCDF
   4.2.1 on top of HDF5 hdf5-1.8.9 with these methods: 

   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;make dir;make all;make ncap2 # Old Makefile mechanism

A. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly read netCDF4 input over DAP, write netCDF4 output, then read resulting file.
   Replacing netCDF4 with netCDF3 in either location of preceding sentence leads to success.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -4 -O -v three_dmn_rec_var http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks ~/foo.nc # breaks with "NetCDF: Invalid dimension ID or name"

   20120731: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report filed: netCDF #QUN-641037: dimension ID ordering assumptions

B. NOT YET FIXED
   netCDF4 library fails when renaming dimension and variable using
   that dimension, in either order. Works fine with netCDF3.
   Problem with netCDF4 library implementation.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -4 -v lat_T42 ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncrename -O -D 2 -d lat_T42,lat -v lat_T42,lat ~/foo.nc ~/foo2.nc # Breaks with "NetCDF: HDF error"
   ncks -m ~/foo.nc

   20120731: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report filed: netCDF #YQN-334036: problem renaming dimension and coordinate in netCDF4 file

C. NOT YET FIXED
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Metadata is returned successfully, data is not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20120731: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Problem hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in query string of HTTP requests.

   Bug report filed: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

D. NOT YET FIXED
   Correctly read scalar characters over.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5 -v md5_a -p http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not yet filed

"Sticky" reminders:

A. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

B. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:
   http://nco.sf.net#rpm

C. Pre-built Windows (native) and Cygwin binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#windows

D. Pre-built AIX binaries:
   http://nco.sf.net#aix

E. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

F. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.

G. Have you seen the NCO logo candidates by Tony Freeman, Rich
   Signell, Rob Hetland, and Andrea Cimatoribus?
