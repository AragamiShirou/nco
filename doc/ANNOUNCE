The netCDF operators NCO version 3.1.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.1.0 contains many internal changes (build,
benchmarking, memory usage, and documentation improvements),
new I/O features, and convenience routines for IPCC processing.

1. OpenMP: No more critical regions in netCDF reads.
   This improves performance on multi-CPU nodes and over OPeNDAP

2. MPI builds (Harry Mangalam): Support configure --enable-mpi

3. MPI: MPI-enabled operators have ZKB (zero-known bugs)!
   Builds them with 'cd ~/nco/bld;make MPI=Y' and run them with mpirun! 

4. netCDF4 builds (Harry Mangalam): Support configure --enable-netcdf4

5. netCDF4: New options -4,--fl_fmt,--netcdf4 for file format
   NB: The -Z switch has been replaced by --64!
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#netcdf4 for more info

6. Compiler support: Intel icc and icpc 8.1 and 9.0 are fully
   supported on x86 and x86_64 architectures

7. Support HTML access when OPeNDAP not installed, e.g.,
   ncks -l ./ http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco/in.nc
   See http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#html for more info

11. ncflint works better with incommensurate files (fxm)

12. IPCC dataset data reduction chapter in manual is more extensive

Enjoy,
Charlie
