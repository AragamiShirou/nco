The netCDF operators NCO version 3.0.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

Version 3.0.2 contains mainly build and benchmarking improvements.
The only user-visible change is one more tweak to the default ncks
printing behavior. There is an important bug-fix for ncap so
ncap users should upgrade. 
Threading is much improved and has been enabled on all arithmetic
operators. Users with SMP machines and OpenMP compilers who want
faster processing should upgrade too.

1. OpenMP: Only one critical region remains in netCDF reads

2. Benchmarks (Harry Mangalam): 

3. ncap (Henry Butowsky): Improved memory efficiency

4. MPI (Gayathri Venkitachalam): New MPI-enabled operators
   mpncflint, mpncecat, mpncwa, mpncpdq, mpncra, 

5. OPeNDAP (Harry Mangalam and James Gallagher): 
   Makefiles support OPeNDAP version 3.5.0+ by default
   doc/opendap.sh demonstrates installing OPeNDAP netCDF client library

Future: The next release (3.1) will concentrate MPI-enabled NCO.

Enjoy,
Charlie
