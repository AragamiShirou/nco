The netCDF operators NCO version 2.0 are ready. 
Improvements to version 1.2.2 are entirely internal.
NCO 2.x is now completely based on the netCDF 3.x API.
This should result in I/O performance gains.
NCO 1.2.x will continue to be maintained for its 
ability to work with HDF4 files, but no new features
will be added.
Get the new version of NCO and read the user's guide on

http://nco.sourceforge.net

Summary of changes:

1. Switched all internal calls to netCDF 3.x API (Butowsky)
2. Added hooks for internationalization to ncra (Zender)

Enjoy,
Charlie
