The netCDF operators NCO version 3.9.3 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This release supplies numerous minor fixes and improvements to netCDF4
capability, and adds more polish to ncap2.

Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
SWAMP efficiently schedules and executes NCO scripts on remote servers:

SWAMP can work with with any command-line operator analysis scripts-- 
not just NCO. If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your
client before you analyze it, then SWAMP may speed things up.
Try SWAMP give us your feedback.

B. Fix file "consanguinity": output file format defaults to input format

C. ncks prints netCDF4 LZ compression information to stdout

D. ncap2 uses OpenMP more, writes nco_openmp_thread_number (Henry Butowsky)

E. ncap2 prints attributes, supports atan2() and pow() (Henry Butowsky)
   Demonstration scripts ~/nco/data/ncap2_tst.nco

I. Reminder: NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO currently supports netCDF4 atomic data types and compression.
   NCO 3.9.3 with netCDF4 support should work with HDF5 1.8 beta2 
   and netCDF4 snapshot20070822 and newer.

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism

Enjoy,
