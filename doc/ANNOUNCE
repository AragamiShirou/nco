The netCDF operators NCO version 2.9.6 are ready.

This release makes large multi-file operations more user friendly.
Using the commandline shell to pass input file names fails on
AIX when the input filelist is 25k characters or more.
Creating symbolic links with names that NCO can automatically 
generate with its -N feature hackish, since then the history attribute 
retains the names of the symbolic links, not the source files.

The solution we now recommend is to pipe long lists of input file
names directly to NCO multi-file operators, e.g., 

/bin/ls | grep ${CASEID}_'......'.nc | ncra -O -o output.nc

This avoids all shell limitations.
When the input file names are specified via stdin, NCO multi-file
operators will store the number of input files in the
"input_file_number" global attribute and the input file names in the  
"input_file_list" global attribute (unless you pass it -H).

This preserves the data processing "chain of evidence".

Build changes:
1. None

Other user-visible changes:
1. Add nco_put_att<int,short,long> functions to libnco_c++
