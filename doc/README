These instructions supercede the instructions in INSTALL because
./configure is not yet working properly.
NCO will run on all major UNIX systems and Windows NT.
All you need to build NCO is a C compiler, preferably gcc, although 
using both a C and a Fortran compiler may result in faster executables.  

The best way to build the operators currently is to type `make' in
this directory. You must be using GNU make, which will default to
using `Makefile' in this directory. I use `Makefile' to develop  
the NCO operators at NCAR. Makefile has hardcoded switches which
may be only valid at NCAR, but which can serve as a template for your
environment. Within Makefile, locate the block of code which
corresponds to your machine type as defined by $PVM_ARCH and the
pvmgetarch command. Within this block you may need to edit the -I and
-L arguments so they include your netCDF library and include
installation paths. This is also where to set the names of the
compilers and linkers, if you are using different tools than I am. 
If you are not using GNU C your C compiler may break on certain pieces
of code ('cc' on Cray works fine, 'cc' on SunOS4.1.x may break but
'acc' should work on all Suns, and 'cc' on SGIs may break).

Read ./Makefile for useful switches you can set.  
Compile with `make OPTS=D' to build debugging versions.  
Environment variables MY_OBJ_DIR, MY_INC_DIR, MY_LIB_DIR and
MY_BIN_DIR control locations of object files, include files,
libraries, and executables. 

The ./configure method for building makefiles does not yet work.
I have included the preliminary (i.e., not working) ./configure.in and
./Makefile.in files so that someone can fix them and send me the
patches. autoconf and fortran are too confusing for me. I repeat,
the ./Makefile currently produced by ./configure does not build the
executables correctly! It is only in the distribution in case someone 
out there who knows autoconf wants to take the time to fix it.

Please read the NCO manual before you submit a bug report!  The manual
is supplied in five different formats: Postscript (nco.ps), Texinfo
(nco.texi), Info (nco.info), HTML (nco.html), and DVI (nco.dvi).
Sending me questions whose answers aren't in the manual is the best
way to motivate me to write more documentation.  I would also like to
accentuate the contrapositive of this statement.

Good luck,
Charlie
