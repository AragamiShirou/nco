What is NCO?
The netCDF Operators, or NCO, is a suite of programs known as
operators. The operators facilitate manipulation and analysis of
scientific data in netCDF or HDF format
(http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf and
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu, respectively).  Each NCO operator (e.g.,
ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s), performs an operation (e.g.,
averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming), and outputs a processed netCDF
file.  The NCO User's Guide illustrates their use with examples from
the field of climate modeling and analysis. The NCO homepage is 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/nco.

Installation:
First, note that NCO does not use ./configure to build.
If you'd like to contribute to NCO, please consider writing the
patches to get configure to work. NCO will run on all major UNIX
systems and Windows NT, however. All you need to build NCO is a C
compiler, preferably gcc, although using both a C and a Fortran
compiler may result in faster executables.   

The best way to build the operators currently is to type `make' in
the `bld' directory. You must be using GNU make, which will default to 
using `Makefile' in this directory. I use `Makefile' to develop  
the NCO operators at NCAR. Makefile has hardcoded switches which
may be only valid at NCAR, but which can serve as a template for your
environment. First, be sure to define NETCDF_INC and NETCDF_LIB
variables either within your environment, or at the top of Makefile.
Within Makefile, locate the block of code which corresponds to your
machine type as defined by $PVM_ARCH and the pvmgetarch command. 
Within this block you may need to edit the CC, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
arguments so they reflect the names of the compilers and linkers.
If you are not using GNU C your C compiler may break on certain pieces 
of code ('cc' on Cray works fine, 'cc' on SunOS4.1.x may break but
'acc' should work on all Suns, and 'cc' on SGIs may break).

Read ../bld/Makefile for useful switches you can set.  
Compile with `make OPTS=D' to build debugging versions.  
Environment variables MY_OBJ_DIR, MY_INC_DIR, MY_LIB_DIR and
MY_BIN_DIR control locations of object files, include files,
libraries, and executables. 

Documentation and Bug Reports:
Please read the NCO manual before you submit a bug report!  The manual
is supplied in five different formats: Postscript (nco.ps), Texinfo
(nco.texi), Info (nco.info), HTML (nco.html), and DVI (nco.dvi).
Sending me questions whose answers aren't in the manual is the best
way to motivate me to write more documentation.  I would also like to
accentuate the contrapositive of this statement.

Good luck,
Charlie
