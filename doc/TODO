*************
NCO Wish list
*************
28. Use var.nc_id as file ID from now on and rewrite old routines to do so
32. Implement packing with scale_factor and add_offset
41. Use GNU getopt_long()
50. Allow user-specified scalar weights to ncwa
51. Make getopt() a shared subroutine
53. Add -t wall clock timer option? (then again, users can always use, e.g., timex())
55. var_conform_dim() should be able to expand a (x,64,128) array into an (nx,64,128) array (maybe)
58. Add -o fl_out switch to supercede positional argument (GNU style)
59. Add "averaged over dimension x from y to z" attribute to ncwa-processed variables
60. Make something that can mask a field without having to average over a dimension
66. Make history attribute get appended, rather than overwritten, when in append mode
69. ncks option for file/field summary: var name list,var min,max,avg,mss_val,# mss_val,
70. ncxx with no options should do usg_prn() without error msg (like ncwa does)
75. Add warning to ncwa triggered by averaging over lat without weighting by gw with NCAR_CSM_FORMAT
79. Allow ncrename .$var_nm syntax to work on all operators (so variables not present cause warning, not error)
82. Make libnco namespace-safe by prefixing all possibly dynamically loaded subroutines with, e.g., nco_
83. Always build operators to link dynamically to libnco.so (autoconf/autotool?)
86. Extend stride/wraparound capability to all operators possible
88. ncks is slow on large files on Crays: ncks -H -v time,date,datesec /tmp/eaton/pcw101/h0009.nc will this be fixed when move beyond netcdf2.4.2 cray libs?
92. ncrcat -O -v base_time,time_offset arm.cdf arm.cdf foo.nc;ncks -H -C -h foo.nc | m gives bad time_offset on LINUX not SUNMP (problem with LINUX adding record coordinate to open file?)
94. ~/bin/sh/texi2html -monolithic nco.texi has started dumping core. adding -verbose switch fixes problem, though I've no idea why.
95. Can Unidata udunits package accomplish CCM "time since..." conversions for ncrcat?
97. Add x_op=average... attributes to averagers for ncar_csm
99. Allow ncatted to print out a file in ncatted format
103. Implement trapezoidal rule option in ncra, ncea
104. Investigate/Document reliability of -A operator when appending from large rank variables to small rank files. Add error message when variables are same size but one has a degenerate dimension.
In general, adding large rank variable to small rank file does work, e.g.,
ncks -C -O -v one_dmn_rec_var in.nc foo.nc
ncks -C -A -v three_dmn_rec_var in.nc foo.nc
ncdump foo.nc
105. Add easy-to-read tabular display option for file contents for ncks
106. Add switch to keep degenerate dimensions with ncwa
107. Migrate to netCDF 3.x
109. Change copyright printing so order is NCO vrs, netCDF vrs, URL, Copyright
111. Investigate whether using ncwa to average files where variables of type 
NC_CHAR have a record dimension causes core dumps or other problems.
i.e., LSM variable timecom caused subtle ncra problems for a while.
113. Rethink normalization switch options in ncwa
114. Fix var_conform_dim() so that the returned weight always has the same size tally array as the template variable
115. When sum of denominator in ncwa (i.e., sum of weight) is zero, SIGFPE results 
Users should not be doing weighted averages if denominator sums to zero, but...
Desired fix here is a graceful exit instead of a core dump
121. Problem reported when mss_val = 0.0 in averagers. C and Fortran 
versions of var_add_real() etc. do not handle missing_value attributes in 
exactly the same way. C versions test both operands agains mss_val,
Fortran tests only op1. Since running averages are initialized to 0.0 before
entry, problems arise in C version when missing_value = 0.0. Only fix seems
to be checking whether tally == 0 before checking whether op2 == mss_val
123. Add HTTP protocol to fl_get() (in addition to DODS)
124. Use `install' program and mkdir -p
127. Make mss: signal retrieval from NCAR mass store
128. Ensure target 'dir' is made before *.d dependency files 
134. Problem on CRAY with ncra test #2, averaging float whose
missing value is double:
ncra -O -C -v rec_var_flt_mss_val_dbl in.nc foo.nc;ncks -H foo.nc
ncra -O -C -d time,0,1 -v rec_var_flt_mss_val_dbl in.nc foo.nc ; ncks -H foo.nc
Not too worried about this since it is Cray specific, 
Maybe 1.0e36d does not convert to 1.0e36f on Crays?
135. Implement OpenMP (threaded) support around variable loops in
ncwa. Requires C compiler with OpenMP (e.g., SGI, Portland Group)
138. If fastest varying dimension of NC_CHAR variable is of size one,
then should not expect it to be NUL-terminated.
139. ncks does not correctly print coordinate indices in hyperslabs with wrapping
ncks -H -C -v one_dmn_rec_var -d time,9,6 ~/nco/data/in.nc
Must compute dmn_ss using WRP information for each dimension
140. ncks prints dimensional indices relative to disk values, but
variable index relative to hyperslab origin for all data types except
NC_CHAR. For NC_CHAR the variable index is also relative to the disk
value, not the hyperslab origin. 
141. NC_CHAR printing should include final dimension coordinates and
character ranges relative to disk. Change variable index-ranges to be
relative to hyperslab to be consistent with all other data types.
142. Implement some way of discriminating between NUL-terminated
strings and non-NUL-terminated characters arrays in ncks printouts.
Perhaps double quotes around former and single quotes around latter
143. Add switch to turn off non-monotonic warning messages in ncra, ncrcat
144. Add option(s) to select all N-D variables where N=0,1,2...
145. Talk to Brian and implement latest netCDF conventions, e.g., time_op
146. Allow proxies for coordinate variables so that, e.g., hyperslabs
may be specified for "date" even though "time" is the coordinate. 
Proxies must be one dimensional and monotonic, of course.
147. Use builtin tempnam() or tmpnam() so file is built in fast
directory rather than, say, NFS-mounted directory like /fs/cgd
148. Put in more useful error diagnostics for Schweitzer's data holes
These only appear in ncra/ncrcat because ncks treats same hyperslab as a wrap!
Must define a consistent convention here
cd ~/nco/data
ncks -O -C -d lon,10.0,80.0 -v time_lon in.nc foo.nc;ncks -H foo.nc
ncrcat -O -C -d lon,10.0,80.0 -v time_lon in.nc foo.nc;ncks -H foo.nc
149. Add ncks hyperslab tests to nco_tst to catch inconsistencies like #148
150. Fully automate RPM production
151. Figure out how to dynamically modify web pages so files with
changing version numbers can be directly linked
152. Change make or nco_dst.pl to add docs to /usr/doc in RPM
154. Add mirror capability to web pages
156. Builds with Electric Fence crash all over the place with nco_tst.sh 
Appears to be related to NCO assumption that NULL=malloc(0)
158. Add policy for hyperslabbing single level values to User's Guide. 
Multi-file operators with record coordinate
treat single point hyperslabs differently than single file operators 
or than any operators with single point cuts on non-record coordinates.
See explanatory notes in lmt_evl().
159. Add capability to handle superfluous intermediate files to ncra,
ncrcat when lmt_typ = dim_idx.
This would allow these multifile operators to handle hyperslabs where,
for example, every other file was not needed. This capability is already
implemented for lmt_typ = crd_val. This is an issue only when stride
is non-unity.
160. Add documentation of ncra, ncrcat superfluous file capabilities to nco.texi
161. Make development installation not depend on old ~/nc/nco paths
162. Add GiNaC (Computer Algebra System) support to ncap www.ginac.de (maybe?)
163. Figure out way to make doc/TAG and doc/VERSION change
automagically. Currently must be updated manually unless distribute
with nco_dst.pl
164. Spiff up NCO homepage web page (Logo?)
165. Create Makefile dependency to do 'make dir' if lib, obj, bin directories do not exist
166. Document 'make test' so people know it exists and use it
167. Improve/redesign test suite so it is more comprehensive and easier to add to
168. Implement autoconf/automake build environment?
169. Merge TODO into sourceforge Task manager and bug manager as appropriate
170. rgn.sh appears to cause core dump over some ocean basins?
173. Add switch to ncra which allows user to remove degenerate time dimension from result
174. Setup ncra,ncea,ncwa to do standard deviations sdn with one call
176. Replace Bison, Flex components of ncap with smaller C++ parser
177. Make RPM production allowable by non-root, since building RPMs as 
sudo root screws up permissions in obj/bin directories of user
178. Make _FillValue behave same as missing_value
179. add netCDF to required packages list in RPM build
180. Allow ncrename to rename attribute of single variable only
181. Split up nc_utl.c into smaller files
182. Add -L switch to print license terms
183. Figure out why makeinfo nco.texi fails
187. Are OpenMP critical regions sufficient for netCDF or must all other threads stop completely?
188. Make binary RPMS build with DODS option
189. Verify ncrcat multithreading works, produced "not a netCDF file error" once
190. Make typ_pck et al. use nc_type enum or something sane for default

Machine-specific problems
************************************************************************
SUN4SOL2/SUNMP:
Solaris requires explicit casting output of strdup() to char * even though string.h is #include'd

SUN4/SUN4SOL2/SUNMP:
Including (void)ncsetfill(out_id,NC_NOFILL); causes crashes on Solaris 2.4 and SunOS
(but not AIX, IRIX, or UNICOS) when the next ncendef() statement is called
	
SUN4:
acc will not do pointer arithmetic with void *, must use char * instead, see var_avg(), e.g.

realloc(NULL,sz) does not act like malloc(sz), contrary to ANSI specs.
cannot link the fortran externals under SunOS with gcc,
i have to use acc to get rid of a __lib_version external reference. With gcc
i have to link with -lansi to get rid of an ___ansi_fflush unresolved external reference.
 unfortunately, acc doesn't dynamically allocate arrays like if(...){float foo[nbr_x][nbr_y]; ...;}

foreach lib (`ls lib*.a`)
echo "searching $lib"; nm $lib | grep lib_version
echo "searching $lib"; nm $lib | grep cg92_used
end

assert causes inscrutable crashes (because it's a macro?) during compilation under sunos.
#ifndef SUN4
(void)assert(argc > 0);
(void)assert(argv != 0);
#end if
  
current makefile doesn't build library correctly, gives non-fatal errors like
ld: /u2/zender/lib/SUN4/libnc.a: warning: archive has no table of contents; add one using ranlib(1)

SGI5:
gcc or as assembler crashes on an enum allocated in a header file, unless it is somehow defined as an extern
workaround is to use #defines instead.
unable to compile in debug mode with same symptoms, e.g., this doesn't work:
gcc -ansi -g -DSGI5 -I/opt/netcdf-2.3.2/include -c ncwa.c -o /u2/zender/obj/SGI5/ncwa.o 
but this does:
gcc -ansi -DSGI5 -I/opt/netcdf-2.3.2/include -c ncwa.c -o /u2/zender/obj/SGI5/ncwa.o

SGI64:
Problems arise in treatment on long int's on this machine. Make sure to
define long data as nclong, and be careful that fortran uses integer*8
when receiving all longs.

AIX:
realloc(NULL,sz) does not act like malloc(sz), contrary to ANSI specs.
getopt() is (re-)declared in stdlib.h
is text trashed in history global attribute in optimized executables?

UNICOS:
alloca(), needed by getopt(), is missing.

LINUX:
no liby.a library, meaning yyerror() is undefined
item 92.: problem with LINUX adding record coordinate to open file?
