<H2>What is NCO?</H2>

<P>The netCDF Operators, or NCO, is a suite of programs known as <B>operators</B>.
Each operator is a standalone, command line program which is executed at
the UNIX (or NT) shell-level like, e.g., <TT>ls</TT> or <TT>mkdir</TT>.
The operators take netCDF file(s) as input, perform an operation (e.g.,
averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming), and produce a netCDF file as output.
The operators are primarily designed to aid manipulation and analysis of
scientific data, and the <A HREF="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/nco/nco.html">NCO
User's Guide</A> illustrates their use with examples from the field of
climate modeling and analysis. </P>

<P>The operators are as general as netCDF itself: there are no restrictions
on the contents of the netCDF file(s) used as input.
The internal routines of NCO are completely dynamic which means that NCO imposes no 
limit on the number of dimensions, sizes of variables, files etc.
NCO is designed to be used both interactively and with large batch jobs.
There are plenty of command line (i.e., runtime) options, but the defaults
settings are often sufficient for everyday needs.</P>

<P>NCO has probably already been built and tested on your operating system
(SunOS, Solaris, Linux, IRIX, UNICOS, and Windows NT).
The current set of
operators is given below. For a thorough description of each operator,
please read the <A HREF="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/nco/nco.html">NCO
User's Guide</A>. </P>

<H2>NCO News</H2>

<P>99/01/21: An optional token has been added to NCO which eliminates
all netCDF 3.x calls and thus restores compatibility of NCO with HDF
files. 

<P>98/12/02: <TT>ncwa</TT> has been updated again since a user
discovered a bug which occurred when a weight (<TT>`-w'</TT>) and a
mask (<TT>`-m'</TT>) were both given to <TT>ncwa</TT>. Unfortunately, 
<TT>ncwa</TT> sometimes produced incorrect answers in this scenario so
if you ever used weights and masks at the same time you are strongly
urged to upgrade your NCO and rerun the commands. This bug only
affected variables averaged with both the weight and mask options
enabled at the same time, no other variables would have been affected. 

<P>
The <TT>`-n'</TT> and <TT>`-W'</TT> normalization options to
<TT>ncwa</TT> have been removed, possibly permanently, but at least
until their implementation is simplified and redesigned. The
<TT>`-N'</TT> option to <TT>ncwa</TT> remains the same. All the new
behavior is fully documented in the rewritten and expanded
<TT>ncwa</TT> section in the 
<A HREF="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/nco/nco.html">NCO User's
Guide</A>.

<P>98/11/24: Choose whether to weight your coordinates in <TT>ncwa</TT>
A <TT>`-I'</TT> switch has been added to <TT>ncwa</TT>.
Henforth, by default, <TT>ncwa</TT> applies weights or masks to
coordinate variables just like any other variable.
Previously, <TT>ncwa</TT> did not weight coordinate variables at all,
and always produced simple arithmetic averages of coordinate
variables.  
Use <TT>`ncwa -I'</TT> to recover the old behavior (i.e., arithmetic
rather than masked, weighted averages of coordinate variables).
A problem where <TT>ncwa</TT> would refuse to average variables which
did not contain any of the averaged dimensions has also been fixed.

<P>98/07/07: Reduce bloating!     
The <TT>`-h'</TT> switch has been enabled on all operators.
Using this switch suppresses the automatic history feature in NCO.
Now you can decide whether each change to a file warrants an
additional line in the history attribute. 
The functionality of the old <TT>`ncks -h'</TT> switch is now
invoked with <TT>`ncks -m'</TT> (the mnemonic is `metadata').

<H2>Using NCO at NCAR</H2>
<P>NCO is built and maintained at NCAR, and so user's of NCAR machines should take advantage of pre-built, up-to-date NCO executables.
The NCO executables are maintained in four different locations at NCAR:
<DD>CGD network (Solaris 2.6): /contrib/bin</DD>
<DD>CGD network (SunOS 4.1.4): /contrib/bin</DD>
<DD>CGD/SCD Winterpark (IRIX 6.2): /contrib/bin</DD>
<DD>SCD Ouray (UNICOS 10.0.0): /home/ouray0/zender/bin/CRAY</DD>
<HR></P>

<DT><A NAME="Bugs"></A></DT>
<H2>Known Problems with NCO and/or netCDF:</H2>
<H1>Are you encountering NCO problems on an SGI machine?</H1>
<P>The netCDF 3.3.x distribution suffers from unpredictable and weird behavior on SGI machines (apparently related to NFS-mounted partitions).
As a result, NCO operators, especially <TT>ncwa</TT>, may core dump unless you upgrade to the new netCDF3.4.x distribution.
NCAR's Winterpark has been upgraded to netCDF3.4.
All users of NCO on SGI64 machines at other institutions are urged to upgrade to netCDF3.4.x which is available from URL <A HREF="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z</A>.</P>

<P>Intermittent problems with NCO on IRIX have reappeared on NCAR's Winterpark since about May 8, 1998.  
Because these problems do not occur on any architecture besides IRIX, I feel it is likely that this is a symptom of a bug with IRIX, not with netCDF or NCO.
These problems are known to occur with NCO (based on netCDF 2.x) as well as other, independent, netCDF 3.x applications (at least since July 28, 1998).
These problems generally occur with the averagers (e.g.,<TT>ncwa</TT>,
<TT>ncra</TT>) and will occasionally produce incorrect answers without
any warning.
Such data corruption might be very hard to notice, so please be very
cautious using netCDF on IRIX until these problems are resolved.
</P>

<P>Try the following workarounds:
If your file on the IRIX machine is accesible from another machine,
e.g., a Sun or Cray, then use NCO from the Sun or Cray, rather than
the IRIX machine, to process the file. 
Some problems are compilation dependent, and disappear or lessen when
NCO is compiled with the `-g' option (rather than `-O2').
Compiling NCO with `C_ONLY=Y' replaces Fortran routines with C
routines.
We have not yet tested whether this alleviates IRIX problems.
If you try either of these workarounds, let me know whether they
worked (or not) for you.
This will help us identify the problem.
