The purpose of this project is to create and improve tools for data
analysis by using Open Source development strategy. The starting
point for this project is the NCO software suite. NCO is a relatively
mature package which requires new ideas, features, and contributors 
in order to remain a useful and vital application.

The netCDF Operators, or NCO, are a suite of programs known as
operators. The operators facilitate manipulation and analysis of
self-describing data stored in the netCDF or HDF formats, which are
freely available (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf and
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu, respectively). Each NCO operator (e.g., 
ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s), performs an operation (e.g.,
averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming), and outputs a processed netCDF
file. Although most users of netCDF and HDF data are involved in
scientific research, these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
are equally useful in fields like finance. The NCO User's Guide
illustrates NCO use with examples from the field of climate modeling
and analysis. The NCO homepage is currently 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/nco.
