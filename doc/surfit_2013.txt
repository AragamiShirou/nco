Next Generation Parser for Structured Data Analysis

PI: Prof. Charlie Zender
    Departments of Earth System Science and Computer Science

Description:
Many if not most geophysical datasets such as climate simulations
are stored in a self-describing data format called netCDF. Our netCDF
Operators (NCO) are a widely used, opensource toolkit for manipulating
and analyzing (statistics, trends, comparison with observations)
netCDF data. 

This project will utilize ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language
Recognition) to generate the NCO language parser in C++. Our goals are  
two-fold: 1. To create and efficient, extensible parser for structured
data analysis. 2. To enhance parallelism in geophysical data analysis
involving structured data with storage constraints.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with C/C++ and language tools (Yacc/Lex/ANTLR...)

Outcomes: Skills and understanding of language construction, data
analysis, open source software development and climate change.
