.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ncap 
arithmetically processes a netCDF file.
The processing instructions are contained either in the 
.B NCO
script file 
.B fl.nco
or in a sequence of command line arguments.
The options 
.B -s
(or long options 
.B --spt
or 
.B --script
) are used for in-line scripts and 
.B -S
(or long options 
.B --fl_spt
or 
.B --script-file
) are used to provide the
filename where (usually multiple) scripting commands are pre-stored.   
.B ncap
was written to perform arbitrary albebraic
transformations of data and archive the results as easily as possible.
Missing values are treated correctly.
The results of the algebraic manipulations are called 
.I derived fields. 

Unlike the other operators, 
.B ncap
does not accept a list of
variables to be operated on as an argument to 
.B -v .
Rather, the 
.B -v switch takes no arguments and indicates that 
.B ncap
should output 
.I only
user-defined variables. 
.B ncap
does not accept or understand the 
.B -x 
switch.
