.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ncecat
concatenates an arbitrary number of input files into a
single output file.
Input files are glued together by creating a record dimension in the
output file. 
Input files must be the same size.
Each input file is stored consecutively as a single record in the output
file.
Thus, the size of the output file is the sum of the sizes of the input
files. 
.PP
Consider five realizations, 
.BR 85a.nc ,
.BR 85b.nc ,
...
.B 85e.nc
of 1985 predictions from the same climate model.
Then 
.B "ncecat 85?.nc 85_ens.nc"
glues the individual realizations
together into the single file, 
.BR 85_ens.nc .
If an input variable was dimensioned [
.BR lat ,
.BR "lon" ],
it
will have
dimensions [
.BR record ,
.BR "lat" ,
.BR lon ]
in
the output file.
A restriction of 
.B ncecat
is that the hyperslabs of the processed
variables must be the same from file to file.
Normally this means all the input files are the same size, and contain
data on different realizations of the same variables.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Consider a model experiment which generated five realizations of one
year of data, say 1985.
You can imagine that the experimenter slightly perturbs the
initial conditions of the problem before generating each new solution.  
Assume each file contains all twelve months (a seasonal cycle) of data
and we want to produce a single file containing all the seasonal cycles.
Here the numeric filename suffix denotes the experiment number
(\c
.I not
the month):
.RS
ncecat 85_01.nc 85_02.nc 85_03.nc 85_04.nc 85_05.nc 85.nc
.br
ncecat 85_0[1-5].nc 85.nc
.br
ncecat -n 5,2,1 85_01.nc 85.nc
.RE
These three commands produce identical answers.
The output file, 
.BR 85.nc ,
is five times the size as a single
.IR input-file .
It contains 60 months of data (which might or might not be stored in the
record dimension, depending on the input files).
