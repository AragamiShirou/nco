2004-06-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_6 mie c++ nco/src/nco_c++
	Changes since nco_c++-0_1_5: Support more put_att attribute types

	* Fix ambiguity in nco_put_att<float &>

2004-06-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add nco_put_att<int,short,long> functions

2004-03-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Print variable names when writes fail

2002-09-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement HAVE_CSTDLIB check to get around lack of SGI CC <cstdlib>

2002-09-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* tst.cc (main): Cast c-strings in trigraph initializers to
	std::strings to make Sun CC happy that both options are same type

2002-09-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_5
	Changes since nco_c++-0_1_4: Comeau support, type-consistent
	initialization 
	
	* libnco_cxx and tst build and execute correctly with Comeau
	compiler 

2002-09-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix errors flagged by Comeau como compiler:
	1. Include cstdlib to get std::exit, std::abort
	2. Initialize size_t *, int * with real pointers not NULL

2002-08-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* SGI IRIX CC does not support std::exit nor have cstdlib, so
	must workaround that.

2002-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_4
	Changes since nco_c++-0_1_3: Long double support in get/put routines
	
	* Added long double type to nco_get/put_var routines and to tst.
	Appears to work

2002-02-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added GPL copyright statements to all files

2002-02-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco_var.hh (file): Added <short> and <short *> types to
	nco_put_var() based on entirely <long> and <int> functions.
	zfm, which uses shorts, now compiles.

2002-01-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Built and tested with Linux icc

2002-01-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Announce on netcdf list

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_3

	* Remove now duplicated in.cdl and modify Makefile paths to know
	about NCO directory structure

	* Moved nco_c++ to nco/src/nco_c++ subdirectory of Sourceforge NCO
	module 

2001-11-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_2 nco_c++ c++ mie

	* Compilation and linking is now successful on AIX.
	Test program completes successful so this the first "port" of 
	the library to non-Linux system has been accomplished.

	* nco_var.hh: Using "typename" instead of "class" solved some, but
	not all AIX compiler warnings. Prefixing typename to std::valarray
	in parameter lists solved the remaining "typename" warnings.
	I am not sure if this is ISO standard requirement or what as
	most books are sketchy on when to use "typename".

2001-11-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco_var.hh: AIX xlC compiler requires use of "typename"
	instead of "class" for template dependent names that are
	types, such as valarrays in nco_put_var(). GCC will work
	with either "typename" or "class". So we use typename.
	Not sure what ISO standard says.

2001-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco_var.hh: Removed redundant template prototypes

2001-10-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1_1 nco_c++ c++ mie
	Changes since nco_c++-0_1: Self-contained code.
	Distribution is now in alpha state and ready for outside
	participation.
	
	* tst.cc: Pared out all non-netCDF junk and dependencies
	so test file should now build on most systems

	* Makefile (MY_DAT_DIR): Hacked to build in.cdl and tst

2001-10-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco_c++-0_1 nco_c++ c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_7: Migrated from c++ directory,
	new module stuff

	* Makefile: Stripped down c++ Makefile to build libnco_c++ only

	* Created README, TODO, moved all libnco_c++ sources into
	own directory and created CVS module nco_c++ which will continue
	to be co-tagged with modules c++ and mie

2001-10-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco.cc: Call nco_inq_dimid() not nco_inq_dimlen()

2001-10-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_8 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_7: new netCDF I/O library replacement
	appears to be working, and complete for all current programs.
	get_vara, put_vara, get_varm, put_varm are not yet implemented.

	* Moved libcsm_c++ to before libnco_c++ in linking (placing leaves
	at end)

	* nco_var_dfn now calls nco_redef() safely

	* nco_hgh.cc: created nco_hgh.cc for high level utilities
	Put nco_var_dfn there so that programs like slr_spc can use
	the var_mtd_sct infrastructure without linking to libcsm_c++

	* nco_var.hh (attributes): Templatized another slew of put_var
	functions.

	* nco_dmn.cc: Fixed about 6 overloads that return rcd instead of
	values like dmn_nbr, var_val, att_nbr.

	* Makefile (CPP_TKN): Added -DNO_NETCDF_2

	* Implement abort() on netCDF errors with -DABORT_ON_ERROR

	* Output var,dmn,att name for failed, fatal inquires

2001-10-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco_var.cc: Fixed bug where starting corner was 1,1,...1 not 0,0,..0

	* Makefile (CPPFLAGS): Added VRS_SNG and VERSION features

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_7 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_6: More attribute overloads
	Fixed namespace usage in libnco_c++ so compilation is cleaner, but
	still unsuccessful, on AIX and ALPHA.

	* nco_att.cc: Having difficult problems with nco_put_att()
	overloads for single element attributes. Not sure why.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Added -Wno-unused to disable warnings for
	unused variables

2001-10-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added optional att_typ to put_att functions

	* Added most overloaded inq_att() and inq_var() functions

	* Moved all template functions into .hh files

2001-10-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Marathon session of adding almost every conceivable overload
	needed for working libnco. Translated all old C++ interface to
	new interface in all C++ code. Removed libnetcdf_c++ linking and
	dependencies. Just need to write a few get_att() functions and
	ready to compile.

2001-10-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_6 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_5: More diagnostic utility functions

	* nco_utl.cc: Added NCO utilties nco_typ_lng(), nco_typ_sng(),
	nco_c_typ_sng(), nco_ftn_typ_sng()

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_5 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_4: New C++ netCDF interface for input file

	* Re-coded input of in.nc to use new interface, appears to work

	* Finally, tied it all together by implementing one line routines
	to return entire variables based on single line string name input.
	This keeps the code required by my C++ interface to about the same
	size as that required by the old, standard, Unidata C++ interface.
	
	* Wrote a number of super-convenience routines to return values
	based on string inputs. This allows things like dimension lengths
	to be returned as const based on dimension name in just one line.

	* Wrote a number of convenience routines to return values rather
	than error codes. This enables simple, one-line, definitions of
	things like dimension IDs, file IDs, dimension lengths, as const
	variables.

2001-10-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_4 c++ mie
	mie-2_5_4 is a synchronization checkin of the last working version
	before adopting new overloaded C++ interface to netCDF 3.X API
	
	* nco_var.hh (file): Added 4 get_var() overloads, and
	nco_get_var_sz() to compute sizes of variables.
	Rudimentary ability now exists to define, inquire, read and write
	datasets.

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_3 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_2: No user-visible changes

2001-10-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Created libnco_c++.hh to contain the nco_???.hh files

	* Broke nco_att.cc into nco_utl.cc, nco_fl.cc, nco_dmn.cc,
	nco_var.cc, and nco_att.cc

	* nco_att.cc: Added 2 overloaded def_var() functions

	* cvs tag -c mie-2_5_2 c++ mie
	Changes since mie-2_5_1: No user-visible changes

	* Makefile: Modify for libnco_c++.a

	* nco_att.cc: nco_att has 3 nearly working overloaded put_att functions

	* nco_att.hh (file): Added nco_att.hh and nco_att.cc to handle 
	 C++ wrappers for netCDF3.X C-interface. 

2001-09-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ccc.cc (main): Using prc_cmp==double appears to work except for
	netCDF I/O issues, may need to write own overloaded class, or use
	alternate C++ implementation based on netCDF 3 with automatic type
	conversion for both input and output (as does Fortran90 interface!)
