Purpose: Installation instructions for libnco_c++

The libnco_c++ distribution is currently maintained as a
gzipped tar file and is available from anonymous FTP from

ftp://dust.ess.uci.edu/pub/zender/nco_c++/nco_c++.tar.gz

To build libnco_c++ with the supplied Makefile, type 'make' using
GNU make. By default, this will build the library libnco_c++.a,
the test program tst, and the test input data file in.nc.
The supplied Makefile requires that GNU make, Perl, and ncgen
be in your executable path.
