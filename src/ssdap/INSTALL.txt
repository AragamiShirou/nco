--------------------------------------------------

System requirements:
-- NCO, the netCDF Operators http://nco.sourceforge.net  
   SWAMP has been tested with NCO 3.
  

Install steps:
-- Configure OPeNDAP to use SWAMP as its netCDF (.nc) handler.
Edit dap-server.rc, located in the same directory as OPeNDAP's nph-dods.  Probably at /var/www/cgi-bin/dap-server.rc
  Look for existing "handler ... dap_nc_handler line"
  Note the existing path to dap_nc_handler
  Replace with path to dap_nc_swamp

-- Configure SWAMP in swamp_handler.conf --> should be placed in the same place as dap_nc_swamp
